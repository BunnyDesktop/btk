General Info
============

This README describes how to use the various test programs
in the bail/tests directory.

To run the various test programs described in this README,
the test libraries must be built and installed.  Running
"make", then "make install" in the bail top-level directory
will take care of this.  Then do the following:

1. Set the environment variable BTK_MODULES to
   "libbail:lib<testname>"

   For example, for ferret, it would be "libbail:libferret"

2. Run the BTK+ test program specified.  These test programs
   are found in the BTK+ build directory in the subdirectory
   called "tests".

Most test programs will display output directly to the 
terminal window where the BTK+ test program was launched.
Some test programs (testtable and testtext) will launch a
test GUI program which allows more interactive testing.

The test GUI has two windows.  The first window is the
"Test Control" window and the second window is the
"Test Output" window.  In the "Test Control" window,
press the button(s) that corresponds to the tests to run
and press the "Run Tests" button at the bottom of the
screen.  Some tests have associated text entry fields
which become active when the button is toggled on.  These
text entry fields correspond to arguments that affect how
the test is executed.  They are pre-filled with default
values but the user can change them if desired.  The
output from the tests is displayed in the "Test Output"
window.


testlib
=======

Contains general purpose functionality that is used by the
various tests.  These include functions that find a specific
widget/BatkObject in the test program, and functions used by
tests that use the Bail Test GUI.


ferret
======

Ferret is a passive in-process test tool for BATK and BAIL.

Run a BTK+-2.0 application such as "testbtk", and ferret will
display a window on screen.   In this window accessibility
information about the BTK+ widgets will appear as they
receive focus.

The ferret window has several tabs, one for each of the
following BATK interfaces.

  Object
  Action
  Component
  Image
  Table
  Text
  Value

Tabs that do not apply to the current widget in focus will be
displayed as inactive.  Clicking on an active tab will display
information about the BatkObject accessed via the BATK API.  In the
Action tab the various actions are displayed as buttons.  When
a button is clicked, the action specified on the button's
label is performed.

If you have installed the "festival" speech synthesis system,
running festival in server mode (festival --server) and turning
on Ferret's Festival support will cause the following to happen:

1. BatkObject accessible names, roles, and keybindings will be
   spoken as they receive focus.
2. When the caret (cursor) is moved in a text field, the 
   current line will be spoken, unless the caret is moved
   just a single character.  In the later case, only the
   single character after the caret will be spoken.

Festival support can be turned on by checking "Festival" in the
menu, or by setting the environment variable FERRET_FESTIVAL
prior to starting the test.  By checking "Festival Terse" or
by setting the environment variable FERRET_TERSE, only the
name of the BatkObject will be spoken (and not the roles and
keybindings).

A magnifier can be turned on to enlarge the widget in focus
by checking "Magnifier" in the menu, or by setting the
environment variable FERRET_MAGNIFIER.  This requires that
the magnifier standalone code is running.

Checking "Track Mouse in the menu or by setting the environment
variable FERRET_MOUSETRACK causes ferret to display information
about the widget that is under the mouse rather than the widget
that has focus.  The mouse is tracked via BtkWidget
"enter_notify_event" signals, so flyweight objects are not tracked.

Checking "Terminal Output" in the menu or by setting the 
environment variable FERRET_ASCII will display the information
that is normally displayed to the ferret GUI window to the
terminal screen.

Checking "No BATK Signals" in the menu or by setting the
environment variable FERRET_NOSIGNALS will cause ferret to
ignore any BATK signals, and it will not update its display
when such signals occur.


testaction
==========

This is a BTK+ module used to test the implementation of the BATK
interface BatkAction, except for batk_action_do_action() in the BAIL 
library. It is normally used with the BTK+ test program testbtk.


testbutton
==========

This is a BTK+ module used to test the accessible implementation 
for buttons. It is normally used with the BTK+ test program testbtk.

Set the TEST_ACCESSIBLE_NAME environment variable to have the test
driver attach to a widget by widget name (compared via the 
btk_widget_get_name function call).

Set the environment variable TEST_ACCESSIBLE_AUTO and the program
will execute the action defined for a BailButton once.


testcombo
=========

This is a BTK+ module used to test the implementation of the BATK action
interfaces on BailCombo. It is normally used with the BTK+ test program 
testbtk by putting the focus in the BtkCombo in entry window.


testcomponent
=============

This is a BTK+ module used to test the implementation of the BATK
interface BatkComponent in the BAIL library. It is normally used with the 
BTK+ test program testbtk.


testimage
=========

This is a BTK+ module used to test the implementation of the BATK
interface BatkImage in the BAIL library. It is normally used with the BTK+
test program testbtk, but can also be used with testdnd when you want
to test BtkPixmap. This modules pops up an extra dialog on startup , containing
BtkArrows and a BtkImage. This dialog has to be closed before control is returned to main window.


testmenuitem
============

This is a BTK+ module used to test the accessible implementation 
for menu items. It is normally used with the BTK+ test program testbtk.

Set the TEST_ACCESSIBLE_NAME environment variable to have the test
driver attach to a widget by widget name (compared via the 
btk_widget_get_name function call).

Set the environment variable TEST_ACCESSIBLE_AUTO and the program
will execute the action defined for a BailButton once.


testnotebook
=============

This is a BTK+ module used to test the implementation of the BATK
interface BatkSelection for BailNotebook. It is normally used with the 
BTK+ test program testbtk.


testobject
==========

interface in batkobject.h in the BAIL library. It is normally used with the 
BTK+ test program testbtk.


testoptionmenu
==============

This is a BTK+ module used to test the implementation of the BATK interfaces
for BtkOptionmenu. It should be used with the BTK+ test program testbtk and
its file selection dialog.


testpaned
=========

This is a BTK+ module used to test the implementation of the BATK
interface BatkValue for BailPaned. It is normally used with the 
BTK+ test program testbtk. It checks the setting of the position 
programmatically and that notification is received if the position
is changed interactively.


testprops
==========

This is a BTK+ module used to test the implementation of BATK properties 
and property change handlers in the BAIL library. It is normally used with 
the BTK+ test program testbtk. To see the changing of the state
BATK_STATE_SHOWING use menus in "progress bar". To see the changing of the
state BATK_STATE_SENSITIVE uses "labels". To see changing of child and parent
use resize check box in "panes".

Set the TEST_ACCESSIBLE_NAME environment variable to have the test
driver attach to a widget by widget name (compared via the 
btk_widget_get_name function call).


testselection
=============

This is a BTK+ module used to test the implementation of the BatkSelection
interface works for the BAIL library. It is normally used with the BTK+ 
test program testbtk and clicking on the menus option. It can also be used
with the BtkCombo which can be accessed by clicking on the entry option.


teststatusbar
=============

This is a BTK+ module used to test that the text on the statusbar
can be retrieved using BailStatusbar. It is normally used with the BTK+ 
test program testbtk and clicking on statusbar button.


testtable
=========

This is BTK+ module used to test the implementation of BatkTable
interfaces.  It can be used with BailTreeView, for example.  It
can be used with any of the following BTK+ test programs:
testtreecolumns, testtreefocus, testtreesort, testtreeview,
or treestoretest.

Set the TEST_ACCESSIBLE_NO_PROPERTIES environment variable
to not receive information about property values changing
(like cell state changes).

Set the TEST_ACCESSIBLE_NO_GUI environment variable to run the
test without the GUI program.


testtext
========

This is a BTK+ module used to test the implementation of BatkText and 
BatkEditableText interfaces on BailTextView.  It is normally used with 
the BTK+ test program testtext started with a text file loaded.
It can also be used with the BTK+ test program testbtk, and then
click on the "entry" or "label" button.

Set the TEST_ACCESSIBLE_NAME environment variable to have the test
driver attach to a widget by widget name (compared via the 
btk_widget_get_name function call).

Set the TEST_ACCESSIBLE_DELAY environment variable to an integer
and the test driver will attach to only a widget on the nth screen
that is displayed.


testtoplevel
============

This test exercises the BatkUtil functions.  It accesses the
batk_get_root() toplevel object, sets/removes global listeners,
and displays the BATK implementation name/version.

Set the TEST_ACCESSIBLE_DEPTH environment variable to control
how deep the children of the toplevel object are displayed.
The default is a depth of 2.  Specifying a depth of -1 will
show the complete hierarchy.


testvalues
==========

This is a BTK+ module used to test the implementation of BatkValue interface
works for the BAIL library. BailProgressbar, BailSpinbutton and BailRange
can all be tested using this module.
