 * @keyval: A Bdk keyboard value.
 * @modifiers: Keyboard modifiers the event is setup with.
 * @key_pressrelease: either %BDK_KEY_PRESS or %BDK_KEY_RELEASE
 *
 * This function is intended to be used in Btk+ test programs.
 * If (@x,@y) are > (-1,-1), it will warp the mouse pointer to
 * the given (@x,@y) corrdinates within @window and simulate a
 * key press or release event.
 * When the mouse pointer is warped to the target location, use
 * of this function outside of test programs that run in their
 * own virtual windowing system (e.g. Xvfb) is not recommended.
 * If (@x,@y) are passed as (-1,-1), the mouse pointer will not
 * be warped and @window origin will be used as mouse pointer
 * location for the event.
 * Also, btk_test_simulate_key() is a fairly low level function,
 * for most testing purposes, btk_test_widget_send_key() is the
 * right function to call which will generate a key press event
 * followed by its accompanying key release event.
 *
 * Returns: wether all actions neccessary for a key event simulation were carried out successfully.
