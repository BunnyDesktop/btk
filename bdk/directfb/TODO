A list of missing things and known bugs in the DirectFB BDK backend:

- Implement more BDK drawing functions. The most important ones
  (including XOR) do work now. Other drawing functions are rarely
  used and would need support from DirectFB.
- Implemenent extended input devices. Shouldn't be too hard.
- Look into DND and selections. DND seems to work inside one
  application at least.
- Consider using the recently added glyph cache in BangoFT2 to
  implement our glyph surface cache. Probably limit the number 
  of cached glyphs or the size of the surface cache instead of
  keeping all glyphs from a number of fonts in the cache.

Some things that will probably never happen:

- Line styles, joining and related stuff. We could use code from the
  LinuxFB backend but it seems to be bloat for most applications.
  Implementing dashed lines would probably make sense and shouldn't
  be too hard.
- Bitmaps (they are partly supported) and masks. This stuff should
  be entirely deprecated. Use real alpha channels instead!


This is a simple list of unimplemented function stubs and there file
