	(merge from HEAD)

	* btk/btkfilechooserdefault.c (trap_activate_cb): "event->state &
	modifiers", not "event->state && modifiers".  Patch by Sadrul
	Habib Chowdhury <imadil@gmail.com>.  Fixes bug #323073.

2005-12-06  Kristian Rietveld  <kris@imendio.com>

	Beginnings of an asynchronous file chooser.

	* btk/btkfilechooserbutton.c: display name and the is folder property
	are now asynchronously set using set_info_for_at_path_iter(), the
	is folder property is now also stored in the tree model.

	* btk/btkfilechooserdefault.c: lots of changes to the shortcuts
	model code to make it operate asynchronously, check_is_folder() has
	been "disabled" for now, all other synchronous calls were
	replaced with asychronous ones.

	* btk/btkfilechooserentry.c: update call to 
	btk_file_system_get_folder().

	* btk/btkfilechooserprivate.h: added two fields.

	* btk/btkfilesystem.[ch]: for about 85% changed to the changes
	outlined in the proposal discussed on btk-devel-list.

	* btk/btkfilesystemmodel.[ch]: updated all asynchronous calls,
	_btk_file_system_model_path_do() basically had to be rewritten
	(and I still need to finish that).

	* btk/btkfilesystemunix.c: changed to be compatible with the new
	BtkFileSystem interface.

	* btk/btkpathbar.c (button_clicked_cb): block/unblock the
	button_clicked_cb callback around the call to
	btk_toggle_button_set_active(), avoids button_clicked_cb getting
	called twice.
	(_btk_path_bar_set_path): refactored to be asynchronous.
