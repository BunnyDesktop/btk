/**
 * SECTION:btkbin
 * @Short_description: A container with just one child
 * @Title: BtkBin
 *
 * The #BtkBin widget is a container with just one child.
 * It is not very useful itself, but it is useful for deriving subclasses,
 * since it provides common code needed for handling a single child widget.
 *
 * Many BTK+ widgets are subclasses of #BtkBin, including #BtkWindow,
 * #BtkButton, #BtkFrame, #BtkHandleBox or #BtkScrolledWindow.
