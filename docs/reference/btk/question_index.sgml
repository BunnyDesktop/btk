<question><para>
How does memory management work in BTK+? Should I free data returned
from functions?
</para></question>

<answer>

<para>
See the documentation for #BObject and #BtkObject. For #BObject note 
specifically g_object_ref() and g_object_unref(). #BtkObject is a subclass 
of #BObject so the same points apply, except that it has a "floating" state 
(explained in its documentation).
</para>

<para>
For strings returned from functions, they will be declared "const"
if they should not be freed. Non-const strings should be
freed with g_free(). Arrays follow the same rule.  (If you find an exception 
to the rules, please report a bug to <ulink 
url="http://bugzilla.bunny.org">http://bugzilla.bunny.org</ulink>.)

<question>
<para>
Why does my program leak memory, if I destroy a widget immediately 
after creating it ?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
If <structname>BtkFoo</structname> isn't a toplevel window, then
<informalexample><programlisting>
 foo = btk_foo_new (<!-- -->);
 btk_widget_destroy (foo);
</programlisting></informalexample>
is a memory leak, because no one assumed the initial floating 
reference. If you are using a widget and you aren't immediately 
packing it into a container, then you probably want standard 
reference counting, not floating reference counting.
</para>

<para>
To to get this, you must acquire a reference to the widget and drop the 
floating reference (<quote>ref and sink</quote> in BTK+ parlance) after 
creating it:
<informalexample><programlisting>
 foo = btk_foo_new (<!-- -->);
 g_object_ref (foo); 
 btk_object_sink (BTK_OBJECT (foo));
</programlisting></informalexample>
When you want to get rid of the widget, you must call btk_widget_destroy()
to break any external connections to the widget before dropping your 
reference:
<informalexample><programlisting>
 btk_widget_destroy (foo); 
 g_object_unref (foo); 
</programlisting></informalexample>
When you immediately add a widget to a container, it takes care of
assuming the initial floating reference and you don't have to worry
about reference counting at all ... just call btk_widget_destroy()
to get rid of the widget.

<question><para>
How do I internationalize a BTK+ program?
</para></question>

<answer>
<para>
Most people use <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/">GNU
gettext</ulink>, already required in order to install GLib. On a UNIX
or Linux system with gettext installed, type <literal>info gettext</literal> 
to read the documentation.
</para>
<para>
The short checklist on how to use gettext is: call bindtextdomain() so gettext 
can find the files containing your translations, call textdomain() to set the 
default translation domain, call bind_textdomain_codeset() to request that
all translated strings are returned in UTF-8, then call gettext() to look up 
each string to be translated in the default domain. 
Conventionally, people define macros as follows for convenience:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
  #define  _(x)  gettext (x)
  #define N_(x)  x
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
You use N_() (N stands for no-op) to mark a string for translation in a 
context where a function call to gettext() is not allowed, such as in an 
array initializer. 
You eventually have to call gettext() on the string to actually fetch the
translation.  _() both marks the string for translation and actually 
translates it.
</para>
<para>
Nowadays, GLib provides the common shorthand macros in the header file
<filename>gi18n.h</filename>, so you don't have to define them yourself, 
just include that header.
</para>
<para>
Code using these macros ends up looking like this:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
 #include &lt;gi18n.h&gt;

 static const char *global_variable = N_("Translate this string");

 static void
 make_widgets (void)
 {
    BtkWidget *label1;
    BtkWidget *label2;

    label1 = btk_label_new (_("Another string to translate"));
    label2 = btk_label_new (_(global_variable));
...
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
</para>
<para>
Libraries using gettext should use dgettext() instead of gettext(), which 
allows them to specify the translation domain each time they ask for a 
translation. Libraries should also avoid calling textdomain(), since they
will be specifying the domain instead of using the default. For dgettext() 
the _() macro can be defined as:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
  #define _(x) dgettext ("MyDomain", x)
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
</para>
<para>
Again, GLib comes with the <filename>gi18n-lib.h</filename>, saving you the 
trouble of defining the macros by hand. The macros in that header expect the 
translation domain to be specified by the %GETTEXT_PACKAGE macro.

<question>
<para>
How do I use non-ASCII characters in BTK+ programs ?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
BTK+ uses <ulink url="http://www.unicode.org">Unicode</ulink> (more exactly 
UTF-8) for all text. UTF-8 encodes each Unicode codepoint as a sequence of 
one to six bytes and has a number of nice properties which make it a good 
choice for working with Unicode text in C programs:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
ASCII characters are encoded by their familiar ASCII codepoints.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
ASCII characters never appear as part of any other character.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
The zero byte doesn't occur as part of a character, so that UTF-8 strings 
can be manipulated with the usual C library functions for handling 
zero-terminated strings.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
More information about Unicode and UTF-8 can be found in the 
<ulink url="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html">UTF-8 and Unicode i
FAQ for Unix/Linux</ulink>.
GLib provides functions for converting strings between UTF-8 and other
encodings, see g_locale_to_utf8() and g_convert().
</para>
<para>
Text coming from external sources (e.g. files or user input), has to be
converted to UTF-8 before being handed over to BTK+. The following example 
writes the content of a IS0-8859-1 encoded text file to 
<literal>stdout</literal>:
<informalexample><programlisting>
bchar *text, *utf8_text;
bsize length;
GError *error = NULL;

if (g_file_get_contents (filename, &amp;text, &amp;length, NULL)) 
  {
     utf8_text = g_convert (text, length, "UTF-8", "ISO-8859-1", 
                            NULL, NULL, &amp;error);
     if (error != NULL)
       {
         fprintf ("Couldn't convert file &percnt;s to UTF-8\n", filename);
         g_error_free (error);
       }
     else
       g_print (utf8_text);
  }
else 
  fprintf (stderr, "Unable to read file &percnt;s\n", filename);
</programlisting></informalexample>
</para>
<para>
For string literals in the source code, there are several alternatives for
handling non-ASCII content:
<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term>direct UTF-8</term>
<listitem><para>
If your editor and compiler are capable of handling UTF-8 encoded sources,
it is very convenient to simply use UTF-8 for string literals, since it allows
you to edit the strings in "wysiwyg". Note that choosing this option may 
reduce the portability of your code.  
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>escaped UTF-8</term>
<listitem><para>
Even if your toolchain can't handle UTF-8 directly, you can still encode string
literals in UTF-8 by using octal or hexadecimal escapes like 
<literal>\212</literal> or <literal>\xa8</literal> to
encode each byte. This is portable, but modifying the escaped strings is not
very convenient. Be careful when mixing hexadecimal escapes with ordinary text;
<literal>"\xa8abcd"</literal> is a string of length 1 !
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>runtime conversion</term>
<listitem><para>
If the string literals can be represented in an encoding which your toolchain
can handle (e.g. IS0-8859-1), you can write your source files in that encoding
and use g_convert() to convert the strings to UTF-8 at runtime. Note that this 
has some runtime overhead, so you may want to move the conversion out of inner 
loops.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
Here is an example showing the three approaches using the copyright sign 
&copy; which has Unicode and ISO-8859-1 codepoint 169 and is represented in
UTF-8 by the two bytes 194, 169:
<informalexample><programlisting>
g_print ("direct UTF-8: &copy;");
g_print ("escaped UTF-8: \302\251");
text = g_convert ("runtime conversion: &copy;", -1, "ISO-8859-1", "UTF-8", NULL, NULL, NULL);
g_print(text);
g_free (text);
</programlisting></informalexample>
</para>
<para>
If you are using gettext() to localize your application, you need to
call bind_textdomain_codeset() to ensure that translated strings are
returned in UTF-8 encoding.
</para>

<question><para>
How do I use BTK+ with C++?
</para></question>

<answer>
<para>
There are two ways to approach this. The BTK+ header files use the subset 
of C that's also valid C++, so you can simply use the normal BTK+ API 
in a C++ program. Alternatively, you can use a "C++ binding" 
such as <ulink url="http://btkmm.sourceforge.net/">btkmm</ulink>
which provides a native C++ API.
</para>
<para>
When using BTK+ directly, keep in mind that only functions can be
connected to signals, not methods. So you will need to use global
functions or "static" class functions for signal connections.
</para>
<para>
Another common issue when using BTK+ directly is that 
C++ will not implicitly convert an integer to an enumeration. 
This comes up when using bitfields; in C you can write the following
code:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
  bdk_window_set_events (bdk_window, 
                         BDK_BUTTON_PRESS_MASK | BDK_BUTTON_RELEASE_MASK);
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
while in C++ you must write:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
  bdk_window_set_events (bdk_window, 
                         (BdkEventMask) BDK_BUTTON_PRESS_MASK | BDK_BUTTON_RELEASE_MASK);
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
There are very few functions that require this cast, however.

<para>
To load an image file straight into a display widget, use 
btk_image_new_from_file() <footnote><para> If the file load fails, 
btk_image_new_from_file() will display no image graphic &mdash; to detect 
a failed load yourself, use bdk_pixbuf_new_from_file() directly, then

To load an image for another purpose, use bdk_pixbuf_new_from_file(). To i
load an animation, use bdk_pixbuf_animation_new_from_file().
bdk_pixbuf_animation_new_from_file() can also load non-animated images, so 
use it in combination with bdk_pixbuf_animation_is_static_image() to load a 
file of unknown type.

<question>
<para>
Why are types not registered if I use their <literal>BTK_TYPE_BLAH</literal> 
macro ?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
The <literal>BTK_TYPE_BLAH</literal> macros are defined as calls to 
<literal>btk_blah_get_type()</literal>, and the <literal>_get_type()</literal> i
functions are declared as %B_GNUC_CONST which allows the compiler to optimize
the call away if it appears that the value is not being used.
</para>

<para>
A common workaround for this problem is to store the result in a volatile 
variable, which keeps the compiler from optimizing the call away.

volatile GType dummy = BTK_TYPE_BLAH;

<question>
<para>
How do I create a transparent toplevel window ?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
To make a window transparent, it needs to use a visual which supports that.
This is done by getting the RGBA colormap of the screen with 
bdk_screen_get_rgba_colormap() and setting it on the window. Note that
bdk_screen_get_rgba_colormap() will return %NULL if transparent windows
are not supported on the screen; also note that this may change from
screen to screen, so it needs to be repeated whenever the window is moved
to a different screen.
<informalexample><programlisting>
BdkColormap *colormap;

colormap = bdk_screen_get_rgba_colormap (screen);
if (!colormap)
  colormap = bdk_screen_get_rgb_colormap (screen);

btk_widget_set_colormap (widget, colormap);
</programlisting></informalexample>
One possibility to fill the alpha channel on the window is to use
bdk_draw_rgb_32_image().
</para>
<para>
Note that the presence of an RGBA visual is no guarantee that the
window will actually appear transparent on screen. On X11, this 
requires a compositing manager to be running. See 
btk_widget_is_composited() for a way to find out if the alpha
channel will be respected.

How do I change the font of a widget?
</para></question>

<answer><para>
This has several possible answers, depending on what exactly you want to 
achieve. One option is btk_widget_modify_font(). Note that this function 
can be used to change only the font size, as in the following example:
<programlisting>
 BangoFontDesc *font_desc = bango_font_description_new (<!-- -->);
 bango_font_description_set_size (font_desc, 40);
 btk_widget_modify_font (widget, font);
 bango_font_description_free (font_desc);
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
If you want to make the text of a label larger, you can use 
btk_label_set_markup():
<programlisting>
btk_label_set_markup (label, "&lt;big&gt;big text&lt;/big&gt;");
</programlisting>
This is preferred for many apps because it's a relative size to the 
user's chosen font size. See g_markup_escape_text() if you are 
constructing such strings on the fly.
</para>
<para>
You can also change the font of a widget by putting
<programlisting>
 btk-font-name = "Sans 30"
</programlisting>
in a resource file and parsing it with btk_rc_add_default_file(). 
The advantage of a resource file is that users can then override the font you

How do I make a text view scroll to the end of the buffer automatically ?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
A good way to keep a text buffer scrolled to the end is to place a
<link linkend="BtkTextMark">mark</link> at the end of the buffer, and
give it right gravity. The gravity has the effect that text inserted
at the mark gets inserted <emphasis>before</emphasis>, keeping the mark
at the end. 
</para>

<para> 
To ensure that the end of the buffer remains visible, use
btk_text_view_scroll_to_mark() to scroll to the mark after
inserting new text.

So you can put non-user-visible data in your model just like any other data, 
and retrieve it with btk_tree_model_get(). See the 
<link linkend="TreeWidget">tree widget overview</link>.

What's the #BtkTreeView equivalent of btk_clist_find_row_from_data()?
</para></question>

<answer>
<para>
As there is no separate data column in the #BtkTreeModel, there's no
built in function to find the iter from data.  You can write a custom
searching function to walk the tree and find the data, or use
btk_tree_model_foreach().

How do I put an image and some text in the same column?
</para></question>

<answer>
<para>
You can pack more than one #BtkCellRenderer into a single #BtkTreeViewColumn 
using btk_tree_view_column_pack_start() or btk_tree_view_column_pack_end(). 
So pack both a #BtkCellRendererPixbuf and a #BtkCellRendererText into the 
column.

I can set data easily on my #BtkTreeStore/#BtkListStore models using 
btk_list_store_set() and btk_tree_store_set(), but can't read it back?
</para></question>

<answer>
<para>
Both the #BtkTreeStore and the #BtkListStore implement the #BtkTreeModel
interface.  Consequentially, the can use any function this interface 
implements. The easiest way to read a set of data back is to use 
btk_tree_model_get().

How do I change the way that numbers are formatted by #BtkTreeView?
</para></question>
<answer><para>
Use btk_tree_view_insert_column_with_data_func()
or btk_tree_view_column_set_cell_data_func() and do the conversion from i
number to string yourself (with, say, g_strdup_printf()).

                        bpointer           data)
{
  BtkCellRendererText *cell_text = (BtkCellRendererText *)cell;
  bdouble d;
  bchar *text;

  /* Get the double value from the model. */
  btk_tree_model_get (tree_model, iter, (bint)data, &amp;d, -1);
  /* Now we can format the value ourselves. */
  text = g_strdup_printf ("&percnt;.2f", d);
  g_object_set (cell, "text", text, NULL);
  g_free (text);

How do I use bairo to draw in BTK+ applications ?
</para></question>

<answer><para>
Use bdk_bairo_create() to obtain a bairo context for drawing
on a BDK window or pixmap. See <link linkend="bdk-Bairo-Interaction">Bairo 
Interaction</link> for some more useful functions.

<question><para>
I have created a bairo context with bdk_bairo_create(), but when I
later use it, my drawing does not show up. Why is that ?
</para></question>

<answer>
<para>
All drawing in BTK+ is normally done in an expose handler, and BTK+
creates a temporary pixmap for double-buffering the drawing. If you 
create a bairo context outside the expose handler, it is backed
by the BDK window itself, not the double-buffering pixmap. Consequently,
any drawing you do with that bairo context gets overwritten at the 
end of the expose handler, when the double-buffering pixmap is copied
back.
</para>
<para>
Possible solutions to this problem are:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
Turn off double-buffering, with btk_widget_set_double_buffered().
This is not ideal, since it can cause some flickering.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
Create the bairo context inside the expose handler. If you do this,
bdk_create_bairo() arranges for it to be backed by the double-buffering 
pixmap. This is the preferred solution, and is used throughout BTK+
itself.

<question><para>
Can I improve the performance of my application by using the
Glitz backend of bairo ?
</para></question>

<answer><para>
No. The BDK X11 backend uses the bairo X backend (and the other
BDK backends use their respective native bairo backends). The
BTK+ developers believe that the best way to improving the BDK
drawing performance is to optimize the bairo X backend and the
relevant code paths in the X server that is uses (mostly the
Render extension).
