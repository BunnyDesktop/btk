  <title>Migrating from SexyUrlLabel to BtkLabel</title>

  <para>
    BTK+ 2.18 supports showing links inside a #BtkLabel, similar to
    SexyUrlLabel. Porting from SexyUrlLabel to BtkLabel is relatively
    straightforward. BtkLabel accepts links in the markup using the
    same HTML <tag>a</tag> notation that SexyUrlLabel uses. In addition
    to the href attribute, BtkLabel accepts a title attribute that
    is displayed as a tooltip on the link. Instead of
    sexy_url_label_set_markup(), just call btk_label_set_markup().
  </para>
  <para>
    One difference between the two APIs is that the ::url-activated signal
    from SexyUrlLabel has been replaced by the #BtkLabel::activate-link
    signal. The need for connecting to this signal is greatly reduced,
    since BtkLabel has a default handler that calls btk_show_uri().
