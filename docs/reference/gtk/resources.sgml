<title>Filing a bug report or feature request</title>

<para>
If you encounter a bug, misfeature, or missing feature in BTK+, please
file a bug report on 
<ulink url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org">http://bugzilla.gnome.org</ulink>. 
We'd also appreciate reports of incomplete or misleading information in 
the BTK+ documentation; file those against the "docs" component of the "btk+"
product in Bugzilla.
</para>

<para>
Don't hesitate to file a bug report, even if you think we may know
about it already, or aren't sure of the details. Just give us as much
information as you have, and if it's already fixed or has already been
discussed, we'll add a note to that effect in the report.
</para>

<para>
The bug tracker should definitely be used for feature requests, it's
not only for bugs. We track all BTK+ development in Bugzilla, so it's
the way to be sure the BTK+ developers won't forget about an issue.
</para>

<title>Submitting Patches</title>

<para>
If you develop a bugfix or enhancement for BTK+, please file that in
Bugzilla as well. Bugzilla allows you to attach files; please attach a
patch generated by the <command>diff</command> utility, using the 
<option>-u</option> option to make the patch more readable. All patches 
must be offered under the terms of the GNU LGPL license, so be sure you 
are authorized to give us the patch under those terms.
</para>

<para>
If you want to discuss your patch before or after developing it, mail 
<ulink url="mailto:btk-devel-list@gnome.org">btk-devel-list@gnome.org</ulink>. 
But be sure to file the Bugzilla report as well; if the patch is only on the 
list and not in Bugzilla, it's likely to slip through the cracks.

<title>Mailing lists</title>

<para>
There are several mailing lists dedicated to BTK+ and related
libraries. Discussion of GLib, Bango, and BATK in addition to BTK+
proper is welcome on these lists. You can subscribe or view the
archives of these lists on 
<ulink url="http://mail.gnome.org">http://mail.gnome.org</ulink>.
If you aren't subscribed to the list, any message you post to
the list will be held for manual moderation, which might take
some days to happen.
