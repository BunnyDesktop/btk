    <title>Building BTK+ on UNIX-like systems</title>
    <para>
      This chapter covers building and installing BTK+ on UNIX and
      UNIX-like systems such as Linux. Compiling BTK+ on Microsoft
      Windows is different in detail and somewhat more difficult to
      get going since the necessary tools aren't included with
      the operating system.
    </para>
    <para>
      Before we get into the details of how to compile BTK+, we should
      mention that in many cases, binary packages of BTK+ prebuilt for
      your operating system will be available, either from your
      operating system vendor or from independent sources. If such a
      set of packages is available, installing it will get you
      programming wih BTK+ much faster than building it yourself. In
      fact, you may well already have BTK+ installed on your system
      already.
    </para>
    <para>
      On UNIX-like systems BTK+ uses the standard GNU build system,
      using <application>autoconf</application> for package
      configuration and resolving portability issues,
      <application>automake</application> for building makefiles that
      comply with the GNU Coding Standards, and
      <application>libtool</application> for building shared libraries
      on multiple platforms.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you are building BTK+ from the distributed source packages,
      then won't need these tools installed; the necessary pieces
      of the tools are already included in the source packages. But
      it's useful to know a bit about how packages that use these
      tools work. A source package is distributed as a
      <literal>tar.gz</literal> or <literal>tar.bz2</literal> file 
      which you unpack into a directory full of the source files as follows:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      tar xvfz btk+-2.0.0.tar.gz
      tar xvfj btk+-2.0.0.tar.bz2
    </programlisting>
    <para>
      In the toplevel of the directory that is created, there will be
      a shell script called <filename>configure</filename> which
      you then run to take the template makefiles called
      <filename>Makefile.in</filename> in the package and create
      makefiles customized for your operating system. The <filename>configure</filename>
      script can be passed various command line arguments to determine how
      the package is built and installed. The most commonly useful
      argument is the <systemitem>--prefix</systemitem> argument which
      determines where the package is installed. To install a package
      in <filename>/opt/btk</filename> you would run configure as:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      ./configure --prefix=/opt/btk
    </programlisting>
    <para>
      A full list of options can be found by running
      <filename>configure</filename> with the
      <systemitem>--help</systemitem> argument. In general, the defaults are
      right and should be trusted. After you've run
      <filename>configure</filename>, you then run the
      <command>make</command> command to build the package and install
      it.
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      make
      make install
    </programlisting>
    <para>
      If you don't have permission to write to the directory you are
      installing in, you may have to change to root temporarily before
      running <literal>make install</literal>. Also, if you are
      installing in a system directory, on some systems (such as
      Linux), you will need to run <command>ldconfig</command> after
      <literal>make install</literal> so that the newly installed
      libraries will be found.
    </para>
    <para>
      Several environment variables are useful to pass to set before
      running configure. <envar>CPPFLAGS</envar> contains options to
      pass to the C compiler, and is used to tell the compiler where
      to look for include files. The <envar>LDFLAGS</envar> variable
      is used in a similar fashion for the linker. Finally the
      <envar>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</envar> environment variable contains
      a search path that <command>pkg-config</command> (see below)
      uses when looking for for file describing how to compile
      programs using different libraries. If you were installing BTK+
      and it's dependencies into <filename>/opt/btk</filename>, you 
      might want to set these variables as:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/btk/include"
      LDFLAGS="-L/opt/btk/lib"
      PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/btk/lib/pkgconfig"
      export CPPFLAGS LDFLAGS PKG_CONFIG_PATH
    </programlisting>
    <para>
      You may also need to set the <envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</envar>
      environment variable so the systems dynamic linker can find
      the newly installed libraries, and the <envar>PATH</envar>
      environment program so that utility binaries installed by
      the various libraries will be found.
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/btk/lib"
      PATH="/opt/btk/bin:$PATH"
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH PATH
    </programlisting>

      Before you can compile the BTK+ widget toolkit, you need to have
      various other tools and libraries installed on your
      system. The two tools needed during the build process (as
      differentiated from the tools used in when creating BTK+
      mentioned above such as <application>autoconf</application>)
      are <command>pkg-config</command> and GNU make.

          needed for that library along with version number information.)

      First make sure that you have the necessary external
      dependencies installed: <command>pkg-config</command>, GNU make,
      the JPEG, PNG, and TIFF libraries, FreeType, and, if necessary,
      libiconv and libintl. To get detailed information about building 
      these packages, see the documentation provided with the
      individual packages.
      On a Linux system, it's quite likely you'll have all of these
      installed already except for <command>pkg-config</command>.

    <para>
      Then build and install the BTK+ libraries in the order:
      GLib, Bango, BATK, then BTK+. For each library, follow the
      steps of <literal>configure</literal>, <literal>make</literal>,
      <literal>make install</literal> mentioned above. If you're
      lucky, this will all go smoothly, and you'll be ready to

	  Normally BTK+ will try to build the input method modules
	  as little shared libraries that are loaded on
	  demand.  The <systemitem>--disable-modules</systemitem>
	  argument indicates that they should all be built statically
	  into the BTK+ library instead.  This is useful for
	  people who need to produce statically-linked binaries.  If
	  neither <systemitem>--disable-modules</systemitem> nor
	  <systemitem>--enable-modules</systemitem> is specified, then
	  the <command>configure</command> script will try to
	  auto-detect whether shared modules work on your system.

         Turns on various amounts of debugging support. Setting this to 'no' 
	 disables g_assert(), g_return_if_fail(), g_return_val_if_fail() and
         all cast checks between different object types. Setting it to 'minimum'
         disables only cast checks. Setting it to 'yes' enables 
         <link linkend="BTK-Debug-Options">runtime debugging</link>. 
         The default is 'minimum'.
         Note that 'no' is fast, but dangerous as it tends to destabilize 
         even mostly bug-free software by changing the effect of many bugs 
         from simple warnings into fatal crashes. Thus 
         <option>--enable-debug=no</option> should <emphasis>not</emphasis>

        <para>
          The option <systemitem>--disable-visibility</systemitem>
          turns off the use of ELF visibility attributes for linking
          optimizations. This makes sense while changing BTK+ itself,
          since the way in which BTK+ uses visibility attributes 
          forces a full rebuild of all source files for any header
          modification.

        <title><systemitem>--enable-explicit-deps</systemitem> and

        <para>
	  If <systemitem>--enable-explicit-deps</systemitem> is
	  specified then BTK+ will write the full set of libraries
	  that BTK+ depends upon into its <literal>.pc</literal> files to be used when
	  programs depending on BTK+ are linked. Otherwise, BTK+
	  only will include the BTK+ libraries themselves, and
	  will depend on system library dependency facilities to
	  bring in the other libraries.
	  By default BTK+ will disable explicit dependencies unless
	  it detects that they are needed on the system. (If you
	  specify <systemitem>--enable-static</systemitem> to force
	  building of static libraries, then explicit dependencies
	  will be written since library dependencies don't work
	  for static libraries.) Specifying
	  <systemitem>--enable-explicit-deps</systemitem> or
	  <systemitem>--enable-static</systemitem> can cause
	  compatibility
	  problems when libraries that BTK+ depends upon change
	  their versions, and should be avoided if possible.

        <para>
	  Controls whether BTK+ is built with support for the XInput
	  extension. The XInput extension provides an interface
	  to extended input devices such as graphics tablets.
	  When this support is compiled in, specially written
	  BTK+ programs can get access to subpixel positions,
	  multiple simultaneous input devices, and extra "axes"
	  provided by the device such as pressure and tilt
	  information. This is only known to work well on XFree86
	  systems, though other systems do have this extension.

          Toggles between the supported backends for BDK. 
          The default is x11, unless the platform is Windows, in which
	  case the default is win32. Other supported backends are
          the quartz backend for OS X, and the DirectFB backend
          for the Linux framebuffer.
