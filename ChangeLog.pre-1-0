	From "Damon Chaplin" <DAChaplin@email.msn.com>
	
	* btk/btktable.c (btk_table_size_request_pass3): Small fix to size
	requisition code.

	* btk/btknotebook.c: Make sure not to do things to page->tab_label

	* btk/btkcurve.c (btk_curve_interpolate): Added a
	missing g_free.

	* btk/btkcurve.c (btk_curve_graph_events): Limits
	were off by one, resulting in writing past array
	bounds. Removed some unused code.

	* bdk/bdk.c (bdk_dnd_drag_begin): The event structure
	used for bdk_event_put should be a BdkEvent, not a 
	subtype, since it will all be copied.

	* btk/btkcolorsel.c: Added a unrealize handler that
	unref's the GC's that were created.

	* btk/testbtk.c (clist_warning_test): ref and sink

	by unparenting their parent.

1998-04-08  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* bdk/bdk.c (bdk_event_translate): During drag and drop, set the
	event mask at ButtonPress time to include ButtonPressMask and
	ButtonReleaseMask, otherwise, if the button is released, and we
	get a LeaveNotify event, it still thinks we are doing a drag.

Tue Apr  7 22:45:37 PDT 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@btk.org>

	* Released BTK+ 0.99.10

	with getc(), Don't interpret /*/ as a full comment. Use
	g_realloc/g_new.

	* btk/btkwidget.h btk/btkprivate.h: Changed all flag
	tests to check for ((BTK_WIDGET_FLAGS(widget) & FLAG) != 0)
	instead of (BTK_WIDGET_FLAGS(widget) & FLAG)

	* btk/btkfilesel.c: Use getwd() instead of getcwd() on  
	SunOS, because getcwd() hangs up in a wait4().
	(Found by David Monniaux <monniaux@clipper.ens.fr>)

	- Check device/inode/mtime not just inode/mtime, when
	caching scanned directories.
	(From: scottk@ig.utexas.edu (Scott Kempf))
	
	* bdk/bdkpixmap.c: Check for 0 width/height when
	creating pixmaps.

	* btk/*.c: Global substitution of recently introduced
	"MAX (0," for allocations to "MAX (1,", since 
	creating a backing pixmap with a zero width or height
	fails.

	* bdk/bdkwindow.c (bdk_window_new): Don't set all the
	WM properties for child windows. Don't set the base
	size, since the value we set will be taken as a minimum
	size.

	* btk/btkwindow.c (btk_window_realize): Set the
	window hints on every map so that BTK_WIN_POS_MOUSE
	works correctly.

1998-04-06  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* btk/btktable.h: 
	* btk/btktable.c (btk_table_set_homogeneous): Added function to

	* docs/btkfaq.sgml: more on GIMP (et al) configure
	  problems.

Mon Apr  6 08:05:23 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btkbutton.c (btk_button_paint): Take border in
	account properly.

	* btk/btktext.c (btk_text_realize): Don't recompute
	geometry when creating with initial 1x1 geometry,
	since our calculations can't handle that. Leave
	text->line_start_cache NULL as sign we don't have
	a real geometry yet.

	* btk/btkentry.c (btk_entry_motion_notify): Use the x
	value we get from bdk_window_get_pointer, not from
	event->x - since we always specify OwnerGrabButtonMask
	(why???), event->x can refer to another window.

Mon Apr  6 08:08:49 BST 1998  Tony Gale <gale@btk.org>

	* docs/btk_tut.sgml examples/helloworld/helloworld.c:
	  Change a missed "delete_event" return value description
	  from TRUE to FALSE.

Mon Apr  6 00:28:28 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btkcontainer.c (btk_container_focus_tab): Make
	tab key move in reading order (left-to-right top
	to bottom) - which might have been the original intended 
	behavior modulo sorting bugs.

	* btk-config.in: Never output -I/usr/include from --cflags

Sun Apr  5 21:47:12 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btkmenubar.c: Fixed bug where right justified
	menu would overlap last left justified item.

Sun Apr  5 19:30:23 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btkclist.c: Fixed assignment of adjustment->value
	to negative values. Moved a few other allocation type things
	around in ways that may or may matter. Fixed some allocation
	errors (scrollbars were overlapping main window).

	* btk/btkbutton.c (btk_real_button_released): Small hack to keep
	button labels from vanishing when the invoked operation blocks.

	* btk/btkbox.c (btk_box_remove): Assigning BTK_WIDGET_VISIBLE (widget)
	to a bboolean (char) is _bad_. BTK_VISIBLE == 256.

Sun Apr  5 15:08:25 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btkmain.c: Reverted broken implementation of removing
	the current timeout/idle. Substituted a (hopefully) functional one.

Sun Apr  5 09:35:55 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@btk.org>

	* btk/btkmain.c (btk_events_pending): take expired timeouts into
	account, otherwise things like e.g. spin-buttons don't work.
	also, count btk_main_quit() as an event.

Sun Apr  5 08:03:01 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@btk.org>

	* btk/btkspinbutton.c: fixed panel allocation and stacking order,
	fixed the base class realization.

	* btk/btkmisc.c: implemented widget arguments. 

	* btk/btkentry.c: fixes in _realize to behave similar to
 	_size_allocate.

Sat Apr  4 12:23:23 BST 1998  Tony Gale  <gale@btk.org>

	* docs/btk_tut.sgml: (btk-crichton-980403-0) subsections on

Fri Apr  3 23:15:55 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btktext.c: Test for need to recompute geometry with
	BTK_WIDGET_REALIZED(), not BTK_WIDGET_DRAWABLE().

1998-04-03  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* btk/btkhandlebox.c (draw_textured_frame): New function to draw a
	nifty "textured metal" frame.  Could be useful in btkstyle.c, maybe.
	(btk_handle_box_paint): Paint a handle that does not make you puke
	when you look at it.

Fri Apr  3 21:03:38 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btktext.c (btk_text_realize): Call recompute_geometry()

	* bdk/bdk.c btk/btkmain.c: Accept debug options 
	in the form --g[td]k[-no]-debug=xxx as well

	* btk-config.in: Added flags --prefix[=dir] and
	--exec-prefix[=DIR] which allow querying and overriding the
	configured-in prefix and exec-prefix.

	* btk.m4: Added configure flags --with-btk-prefix=
	and --with-btk-exec-prefix= to set the --prefix and
	--exec-prefix argumetns to btk.m4

Fri Apr  3 17:14:55 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* bdk/bdk.c: More extensive debugging output

	  btk/btktreeitem.c btk/btkviewport.c

	Avoid assigning negative values to unsigned allocation.width and
	height

	* btk/btkwindow.c:

	Instead of realizing the widget, then size allocating, (resulting
	in XMoveResizeWindows for all children, do the size allocation
	first, then realize. 

	In btk_real_window_move_resize, combine move and resize
	into a single BDK/X call when possible.

	Remove assumption that the widget will be size allocated _after_
	it is realized.

	* btk/btkentry.c: New algorithm to get more normal behavior
	with scroll_offset when changing fonts.

Tue Mar 31 06:37:16 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@btk.org>

	* btk/testbtk.c (create_cursors): forgot to set the initial `0' cursor.

1998-03-30  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* bdk/bdkdnd.c (bdk_dnd_display_drag_cursor): First fix: Move the

Mon Mar 30 21:29:43 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btkentry.c: Add a "style_set" callback, so the
	font can be changed at run time. (needed for GIMP text
	tool)

	(btk_notebook_update_labels): if we have a tab_label, then use its label
	as the default menu_label.

Mon Mar 30 16:35:57 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/testbtk.c: Improved main loop test. (Quits main
	loop properly, makes it more obvious to the user
	what is going on)

	* btk/btkwidget.c (btk_widget_unparent): Reset the
	allocation _after_ clearing the window.

	* configure.in: If can't find XShmAttach in Xext, check
	in XextSam (for AIX).

	* btk/btkmain.c (btk_events_pending): Remember, small
	numbers are _high_ priority for idle queues.

	* btk/btkmain.c (btk_handle_current_timeouts): Allow
	removing the currently running timeout.

	it was unneeded and not exported.

	* btk/btkwidget.c (btk_widget_ref) (btk_widget_unref): don't check-cast
	the widgets to volatile BtkObjects (which was there for debugging
 	purposes only). these functions should probably be macros, but that
 	would break binary compatibility again, sigh.
	(btk_widget_destroy): removed superfluous check-casts, since the
 	neccessary checks are done in btk_object_destroy anyways. this should
	be a macro as well but stays as a function for the above reasoonings.

Mon Mar 30 17:21:27 BST 1998 Tony Gale  <gale@gimp.org>

	* docs/btk_tut.sgml: reflect the change of meaning
	  of the delete_event return value

	* btk/btkcombo.c (btk_combo_disable_activate):

	* bdk/bdk.c (bdk_event_translate): Don't call
	XTranslateCoordinates on a destroyed window. (Why do we
	do event processing at all on destroyed windows when we
	throw out the results?)

	* btk/btklabel.c: Clear the background when changing style/
	state.

Fri Mar 27 16:35:00 PST 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@btk.org>

	of fontset ascent/descent.

	* btk/btkwidget.[ch]: Added new function to show a toplevel

	* docs/Makefile.sgml: some stuff for doing plain text and
	  postscript

Fri Mar 27 00:13:18 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btkmain.c (btk_propagate_event): If the widget is _not_
	a descendant of a Window widget, propagate key presses like
	other events.

	* btk/btkentry.c btk/btktext.c: Ignore multiple simultaneous
	button presses instead of treating subsequent presses as
	release/press pairs for tablet compatibility.

	* configure.in config.h.in: Removed inline checks, because they
	are duplicated in bunnylib.

	* btk/btkwidget.c (btk_widget_draw): When btk_widget_draw ()
	occurs with queued draw already in place, redraw _entire_
	widget. (Pointed out by Tim Janik)

Thu Mar 26 23:12:54 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@btk.org>

	* btk/btkmain.c (btk_propagate_event): make a clear distinction between
	key press/release events, which will be sent to a widgets toplevel
	ancestor and be forwarded from there, and all other events that need to
 	get propagated up the widget tree (pointed out by Owen Taylor).

	* btk/btkcheckbutton.c (btk_real_check_button_draw_indicator): always
	display the correct active state.

	* btk/btkwidget.c (btk_widget_set_arg): CAN_FOCUS and CAN_DEFAULT flag
 	changes need to queue a resize.

	* btk/btkbutton.c (btk_button_paint): take border_width into
 	consideration for restrict area.

	* btk/btktogglebutton.c (btk_toggle_button_class_init): enable the
 	draw_default member of BtkButton, otherwise the diplay is messed up
	for CAN_DEFAULT toggles.

	internal use only.

	* btk/btkmain.c (btk_quit_add_destroy): new function which will destroy

	* btk/btkstatusbar.h: 
	* btk/btkstatusbar.c: complete api change to honour message contexts.
	unfortunaltely this also involved argument changes on the signal
 	emissions which will not be caught by the compiler. your callbacks
 	should look like:

				   buint           context_id,
	                           const bchar    *text,
				   bpointer        func_data);

	* btk/btkwidget.c (btk_widget_set_rc_style): eliminated bug about
	initial signal emission.
	(btk_widget_set_parent): don't ensure style, just call
	btk_widget_set_style_recurse.

	if there has already been a lookup.

	* btk/btkentry.[ch] btk/btktext.[ch] btkeditable.[ch]

	Turned off debugging in btktext.c

	Bug fixes for cutting, pasting, deleting, etc. 

	Some of the bugs that were there before have definitely

	* btk/testbtk.c btk/testbtkrc: Removed my ugly orange backgrounds,
	to make things look nicer. 
	
Sat Feb 28 23:58:54 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btkentry.[ch] btktext.[ch] btkeditable.[ch]

	Created a new base widget type Editable for the entry and
	text widgets, which encapsulates most of the selection and
	clipboard handling stuff, plus some common signals.

	Changed the Entry widget extensively to support this, 
	but the interface and appearance should be the same.

	Changed the Text widget moderately to support this.

	It now supports:

	- Selection style cut and paste
	- Clipboard style cut and paste
	- Emacs style key bindings (~same as Entry)
	- Word motion
	- "changed" signal

	There are definitely still some bugs in the new stuff.

	Use style->base for the background and style->text for
	the foreground.
	
	* btkfilesel.c btkspinbutton.c testbtk.c: small changes
	to fit the new interface more exactly.
	
Sat Feb 28 19:29:09 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gimp.org>

	* btk/btkclist.c (btk_clist_new_with_titles): retrive the clist widget

	* btk/btktipsquery.c: we make an active server grab now, this way we
	can change the cursor globally and don't need to tweak event masks
	of other windows.

	* btk/btkwidget.h:
	* btk/btkwidget.c:

	* btk/testbtk.c btk/circles.xbm: new test for WM hints.

Wed Feb 25 22:56:42 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gimp.org>

	* btk/btkspinbutton.h: 
	* btk/btkspinbutton.c:
 	new widget from Lars Hamann <hamann@braunschweig.netsurf.de> and
	Stefan Jeske <jeske@braunschweig.netsurf.de>.

	* btk/btknotebook.c: fixups from lars and stefan.

Wed Feb 25 13:18:53 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btkbbox.[ch] btk/btkhbox.[ch] btk/btkvbox.[ch] :

	Move layout constants into an enumeration, split
	BTK_BUTTONBOX_DEFAULT into BTK_BUTTONBOX_DEFAULT

	* btk/btkclist.c:

	Renamed btk_clist_row_isvisable to .._is_visible

	From: Maciej Stachowiak <mstachow@mit.edu>
	
Wed Feb 25 13:50:05 GMT 1998  Tony Gale <gale@gimp.org>

	* docs/btkfaq.sgml: added questions on:
		- Why don't the contents of a button move when 
		  the button is pressed?
        	- How do I catch a double click event in 
 		  a list widget?         
     		- When compiling BTK+ I get an error like: 
		  make: file `Makefile' line 456: Syntax error 
          Removed questions on menus which are covered in the
	  tutorial.

	  Added link to HTML versions of FAQ and Tutorial on my
	  web site.

Tue Feb 24 22:47:01 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btktext.c: Added some support for i18n. The support 
	for input methods, including preedit, is there, but input
	is ignored unless it comes one byte at a time, so the
	CJK locales won't really work. Fixing that would require
	variable-width character support in the Text widget, which
	is probably the wrong approach. Eventually we'll probably
	want to go to UCS-4 internally.

	Also, revised key press handling, which should improve
	the forwarding of non-handled keypresses to the toplevel,
	and make adding selection handling easier.

	* btk/btkentry.c: Minor changes so that C-d, etc delete
	the selection if there is one.

	* bdk/bdk.c (bdk_ic_get_events): Check the result of
	XGetICValues - it is failing for some reason, and 
	causing some warnings to be printed.

Mon Feb 23 15:41:13 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btkwidget.c btk/btkmenu.c: Don't process configure events
	that just move the window, and don't resize it. Because we need
	to make sure that a widget gets redrawn after a size_allocate -
	and that only happens when the configure event changes the size
	of the window. Plus, it's inefficient.
	
Mon Feb 23 15:45:37 1998  Marc Ewing <marc@redhat.com>

	* btk/btktoolbar.h:
	* btk/btktoolbar.c:
	Added btk_toolbar_*_element() functions.  Rewrote others
	to simply call btk_toolbar_insert_element() to do the
	work.
	Added two new BtkToolbarChildType options: TOGGLEBUTTON and
	RADIOBUTTON, available through the btk_toolbar_*_element() functions.
	
Mon Feb 23 13:44:10 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gimp.org>

	* btk/btkstatusbar.h:
	* btk/btkstatusbar.c:

 	code, but then there was nothing to fix.

Sun Feb 22 20:42:04 1998  Marc Ewing <marc@redhat.com>

	* btk/btkclist.c (btk_clist_insert): Allow inserts
	on empty clists.
	
Sun Feb 22 14:28:43 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btkmain.c (btk_events_pending): Count idle handlers
	at internal priority as pending events.

Sun Feb 22 00:20:12 MET 1998  Eckehard Berns  <eb@berns.prima.de>

	* bdk/bdkcc.c (bdk_color_context_query_colors): fixed a bug for mode
	BDK_CC_MODE_TRUE, when on a 24-bit visual on a 32-bit mashine.

Sat Feb 21 15:33:20 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gimp.org>

	* btk/btkwidget.h: 
	* btk/btkwidget.c: renamed signal BtkWidget::set_parent to
	BtkWidget::parent_set. since it's purpose is pure notification,
	it should have been named this way in the first place.

Sat Feb 21 12:06:11 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* btk/btkentry.c (btk_entry_set_text): Added a test for passing a
	NULL text pointer.

Sat Feb 21 14:49:17 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gimp.org>

	* btk/btkobject.h:

 	now which if supplied will point to an array holding the sequential
	argument ids.

	* btk/btktree.c: fix emission of selection_changed signal, supplied
	by Bolliet Jerome.

	* btk/btktreeitem.c: inline the plus and minus pixmaps, supplied by
	Bolliet Jerome.

	* btk/btknotebook.c: do a resize when a page is removed and don't
	refer to the removed page on the switch signal, supplied by Lars Hamann
	and Stefan Jeske.

	* btk/btktoolbar.h:
	* btk/btktoolbar.c:
 	btk_toolbar_append_item, btk_toolbar_prepend_item,
 	btk_toolbar_insert_item, btk_toolbar_append_widget,
	btk_toolbar_prepend_widget, btk_toolbar_insert_widget: take an additional
 	bchar *tooltip_private_text as argument to fully support the underlying
	call to btk_tooltip_set_tip.

Fri Feb 20 06:40:00 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gimp.org>

	* btk/btktipsquery.h: 
	* btk/btktipsquery.c:
 	New widget BtkTipsQuery for letting the user query tooltips of widgets.

	* btk/testbtk.c: add example for BtkTipsQuery.

	* btk/btk.h: include btk/btktipsquery.h.

	* btk/btklabel.c: enable default constructing.
	

Thu Feb 19 18:53:51 1998  Larry Ewing  <lewing@discord.isc.tamu.edu>

	* removed g_warnings from the common XShm failure cases in bdkimage.c

1998-02-19  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* btk/btkcombo.c (btk_combo_entry_key_press): Added M-p and M-n
	key equivalents for up and down keys.  Just for us Emacs weenies :-)

Thu Feb 19 12:18:24 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/testbtk.c : Use POINTER_MOTION_HINT when dragging

	 Stefan Wille  <1wille@vsys1.informatik.uni-hamburg.de>)

	* btk/btktext.c : Fixes to inserting and deleting characters
	on line breaks.
	(btk-magnus-980210-0 Magnus Hulthen <magnus@axiom.se>)

	* bunnylib/configure.in bunnylib/bunnylibconfig.h.in: the value of
	---enable_debug is written into bunnylibconfig.h so everything
	is recompiled when it changes. (HACK)

	* btk/btkmain.c bdk/bdk.c docs/debugging.txt:
	Added --bdk-no-debug and --btk-no-debug switches. Effect
	of switches is no cumulative.

Thu Feb 19 06:56:52 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gimp.org>

        * btkbox.c:
        * btkbutton.c:
        * btkcontainer.c:
        * btkframe.c:
        * btklabel.c:
        * btkobject.c:
        * btkwidget.c:
        * btkwindow.c:
        present the argument access masks on their announcement.

        * btk/btkobject.h:
        * btk/btkobject.c:
        (btk_object_add_arg_type): take an additional argument describing
        the access mask of the new arg. this can be of BTK_ARG_READABLE,
        BTK_ARG_WRITABLE or BTK_ARG_READWRITE (the latter is an alias for
        the two previous ones).
        (btk_object_query_args): provide an access_mask array if desired.

        * btk/btkwidget.c (btk_widget_real_realize):
        realized the assumtion that widget is a NO_WINDOW widget
        in actuall code.

        * btkwindow.c:
        slight changes to btk_window_configure_event that will make
        the resizing behaviour a little less odd.
        sigh, for some (buggy) reason, there are still container resizes
        triggered by manual resizing to very small window sizes.
        the cointainer resizes will cause btk_real_window_move_resize to
        be invoked, which makes the app look like it wants to fight the users
        resizing action. ;(

Thu Feb 19 01:11:48 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* configure.in         bdk/bdk.[ch]         bdk/bdkcc.c

	* G_ENABLE_DEBUG enables run time checking which controls:
	    Object tracing
	    Showing events
	    Miscellaneous g_print's in BDK
	  And is controlled by --bdk-debug/BDK_DEBUG, --btk-debug/BTK_DEBUG
        * debug_level and show_events are gone from BTK

	See docs/debugging.txt for details.
	
	And some fixups to the configure.in's so '-g' can be
	overriden on the command line for --enable-debug

	  can be reparented properly.

Mon Feb 16 23:47:09 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btkviewport.c: (btk-fortier-980130-0)
	  From Patrice Fortier <Patrice.Fortier@aquarel.fr>
	
	  Eliminate some extra expose events for viewports.
	  (To be conservative, I set the user's event mask for
	   both widget->window, and viewport->bin_window  -owt)

Mon Feb 16 23:12:14 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btkmain.c: Make timeout and idle insertion code
	  use g_list_insert_sorted().

Mon Feb 16 17:35:17 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btktreeitem.c: Use btk_signal_default_marshaller,
	  for expand/collapse signals.

Fri Feb 13 19:08:51 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gimp.org>

	* btk/btkclist.c (check_exposures): check for clist !REALIZED.
	(draw_rows): bail out if the widget isn't drawable.
	(hadjustment_value_changed): 
	(vadjustment_value_changed): bail out if clist isn't drawable.

	* bdk/bdk.c (graphics_expose_predicate): check for private != NULL.
	(bdk_event_get_graphics_expose): check for window != NULL.

Fri Feb 13 00:33:26 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/testbtk.c (shape_create_icon): Realize window before
	  creating xpm so it gets the right colormap/visual,
	  instead of the default one.

Thu Feb 12 23:59:49 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btksignal.[ch] btk/btkmain.[ch] btk/btkcontainer.[ch]
	  btk/btkselection.[ch] bdk/bdk.[ch] btktypeutils.h 
	  
 	  Replaced all _interp functions with _full functions.
	  (_interp functions left in for compatibility until 0.99.5). 
	  Difference: _full functions take _both_ a C-language callback and a
	  marshaller, and simply ignore the C-language callback
	  if the marshaller is present. This allows the destroy notification
	  to be used without marshalling.

	  btk_selection_add_handler[_full]() regularized to agree
	  with other callbacks.
	
	  Also, added btk_input_add_full() to the header file. 
	  (btk_input_add_interp() was never there)

	* btk/btkmain.[ch] btk/btkwidget.c: Idle functions are now prioritized.
	  Added new function btk_idle_add_priority to create
	  an idle with a specified priority (default is zero)
	  constants #defined - BTK_PRIORITY_[HIGH/INTERNAL/DEFAULT/LOW]
	  (redraws, resizes run at BTK_PRIORITY_INTERNAL)
	
	* btk/btkentry.c btk/testselection.c: changes to keep up with change
  	  to btkselection.c. 

	* btk/btkentry.c btk/btkinputdialog.c btk/btklist.c
	  btk/btklistitem.c btktree.c btk/btktreeitem.c testbtkrc:

	  Change style->white to style->base[] where appropriate.
	  Change the default style to make this apparent. (Yes, its
	  ugly... it can be removed later)
	
Tue Feb 10 15:01:44 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btkobject.c btk/btkobject.h: Add a DestroyNotify
	field, and btk_object_set_data_full() to match.

	* btk/btkobject.c (btk_object_finalize): ObjectData structures
	were being added to a free list, then forgotten about. Just
	rely on GMemChunk instead.

2018-02-11  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* btk/btkclist.c:

	* btk/btktext.c:
	* btk/btkviewport.c:
	Fixed unrealize handler to comply with the
	documentation (which mentions the right thing to do).

Wed Feb 11 00:18:31 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gimp.org>

	* docs/refcounting.txt: backed out the section "Gnits to care about".
	* docs/developers.txt: new file, kinda developers FAQ.

	* btk/btksignal.c: new function btk_signal_handler_pending() returning
	  the id of the next handler pending for that signal or 0.
	  put struct BtkHandler back into btksignal.c along with
 	  btk_signal_get_handlers.

Tue Feb 10 07:12:07 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gimp.org>

        * btk/btksignal.h:
        * btk/btksignal.c:
        ok, there have been several severe bugs in the signal handler
        referencing and ->next connection stuff. these bugs caused
        invokations of handlers that are disconnected and - worse -
        destroyed already. invokation of *destroyd* handlers mean:
        anything can be executed , because the handler structure can just
        as well be realocated.
        at the cost of an extra ->prev field per handler we should have a
        reasonable stable system now, because of the various places that
        can cause a handler to be disconnected (*any* handler invokation can
        cause *any* or *all* handlers to be disconnected, there is no way
        around a doubly linked list, actually handler disconnection has never
        worked correctly because of this.
        handlers are connected together via a *doubly* linked list now, and it
        is *not* valid to remove a handler out of this list untill all its
        references have been droped, i.e. handler->ref_count==0.
        to prevent emissions of disconnected but still referenced handlers,
        disconnected handlers are simply marked as blocked and get an id of 0
        which is an invalid signal handler id.
        the handler->id has been changed to have 28 significant bits (using
        alignment gaps), since 65536 (old range: buint16) signal connections
        (as a total) can easily be reached by complex applications.
        this whole handler thingy is at least as tedious as writing doubly
        linked list implementations ;)

Mon Feb  9 23:08:16 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btkwidget.c (btk_widget_unparent): Check for
	  the RESIZE_NEEDED flag and remove the widget from the list.
	  Remove the check from btk_widget_destroy (no longer needed).

	* Unrealize widget _before_ calling "destroy" signal, and
	  unset VISIBLE flag.

	* Unrealize child widgets _after_ unrealizing parent to improve
	  visual appearance.

Mon Feb  9 16:42:21 1998  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* btk/btksignal.c (btk_signal_get_handlers): no longer a private
	routine;
	btksignal.h: export btk_signal_get_handlers and BtkHandlers type. 

Sun Feb  8 07:06:54 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gimp.org>

	* btk/btkmenu.c (btk_menu_get_attach_widget): new function to return
 	  the widget that the menu is attached to.

Sat Feb  7 11:33:08 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* bdk/bdkgc.c (bdk_gc_copy): use a mask of 0xffffffff
	  instead of 0xffff, since there are 22 flags currently
	  defined. (From: Jon Trowbridge <trow@emccta.com>)

	  Changed to something better. ~((~1) << GCLastBit)
		   (From: from Daniel Stephens <daniel@cheeseplant.org>)
	
Sat Feb  7 02:29:01 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gimp.org>

	* bdk/bdk.c (bdk_event_translate): don't wipe out window_private's x
	  and y coordinates if the configure notify is only about resizing,
	  query the correct origin instead.

Wed Feb  4 23:05:28 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* btk/btkmenufactory.c: menufactories now ref&sink the menus they
  	create

Thu Feb  5 02:13:08 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gimp.org>

	* btk/btklist.h:
	* btk/btklist.c (btk_list_remove_items_no_unref): new function
	  to perform the same actions as btk_list_remove_items, but
	  supply the removed widgets with an additional reference count.

	* btk/btkmain.c (btk_main_iteration_do): ignore events
	  with event_widget == NULL, since they are bogus events
	  from destroyed BdkWindows, exept for the case where
 	  event->type==BDK_PROPERTY_NOTIFY. Always handle expired
 	  timeout functions when returning from this function.

	* btk/btkwidget.c (btk_widget_event): ignore BDK_EXPOSE events
	  if event->window == NULL. Also, if this function couldn't handle
	  the event for any reason (including failing assumptions), make
	  the return value to look as if the event had been handled to
	  avoid further processing (and warnings).
	  
	* btk/btkwidget.h:
	* btk/btkwidget.c: remove btk_widget_sink, because there is
	  no point in providing such a function.

	* bdk/bdk.c (bdk_init): changed options `-name' and `-class'
	  to `--name' and `--class', because the old names would
	  confuse getopt(). these arguments have been introduced in the
	  changes from btk+970916 to btk+970925 without a ChangeLog entry,
	  changing argument names is painful, it would be nice if people
	  would care about compatibility and consistency in the first place!

Tue Feb  3 15:09:55 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gimp.org>
	
	* docs/widget_system.txt: new file containing notes about
	  the inner workings of the widget system of BTK+, a widget
	  flag description and certain invariants about widget states.
	
	* docs/refcounting.txt: moved file (previously REFCOUNTING)
	  introducing The Reference Counting Scheme of BDK an BTK+.
	  lots of additions/corrections.

        * btk/btksignal.c (btk_signal_real_emit): for the emission
          of AFTER signals, fetch the objects signals via
          btk_signal_get_handlers again. some handlers might have
          been removed or added. not doing this would mess up the
          memchunk allocation of signal handlers (this had been
          triggered by multiple *_while_alive connections), bad, bad, bad!
          (btk_handlers_run): do the referencing on signal handlers
          unconditionally, the invokation of AFTER handlers will now take
          care of modified lists.

        * btk/btksignal.h: added btk_signal_connect_while_alive.

Tue Feb  3 15:34:27 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* bdk/bdkcolor.c (bdk_colormap_get_system): Only query
	  the colormap for GRAYSCALE and PSEUDOCOLOR visuals,
	  and don't ask for more than 256 colors in any case.

	* bdk/bdkwindow.c (bdk_window_internal_destroy): Remove
	  the input window information when we destroy the window,
	  not when we are notified of it.

	* bdk/bdkinputcommon.h (bdk_input_device_new): Work around
	  bug in XFree86 3.3.1's handling of Wacom macro buttons.
	  by assumming no device will report exactly 25 buttons.

	* bdk/bdkinputcommon.h (bdk_input_common_other_event): Fill
	  in string translation for generated key press events,
	  do sanity checking on received key codes.

	* bdk/bdkcc.c (bdk_color_context_new): Allocate enough
	  room for a BdkColorContextPrivate, not just for a 
	  BdkColorContext.

Tue Feb  3 15:09:55 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gimp.org>

	* btk/testbtk.c: don't add the same menu to different menuitems/
	  optionmenus.

	* btk/btkmenuitem.h:
	* btk/btkmenuitem.c: new function btk_menu_item_remove_submenu ro
	  be consistent with optionmenu. use btk_menu_attach_to_widget/
	  btk_menu_detach for setting/removing the submenu.
	  invoke btk_widget_destroy(submenu) in destructor to be consistent
	  with other destructors.

	* btk/btkoptionmenu.h: 
	* btk/btkoptionmenu.c: attach/detach to menu widget via
	  btk_menu_attach_to_widget/btk_menu_detach.
	  invoke btk_widget_destroy(menu) in destructor to be consistent
	  with other destructors.

	* btk/btkmenu.h: 
	* btk/btkmenu.c: new functions btk_menu_attach_to_widget
 	  and btk_menu_detach that correspond to the action of
	  btk_widget_set_parent and btk_widget_unparent.

	* btk/widget.c: few fixups.

Tue Feb  3 00:12:00 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>
	* btk/btktable.c 
	  Fixed problem with division by zero in row/column-spanned
	  tables. Also removed a bunch of conditionals by making
	  the observation that x/1 == x.

Mon Feb  2 04:15:08 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gimp.org>

	* btk/btkwindow.c:
	* btk/btkwidget.c:
	* btk/btkmain.c:
	* btk/btkwidget.c:
	* btk/btkcontainer.c:

	  bug that could caused unreferencing of finalized objects.

	* btk/testbtk.c: destroy fileselection on "OK" (this triggered the
	  above mentioned bug).

	* btk/btkwidget.h:
	* btk/btkwidget.c:
	* btk/btkobject.h:
	* btk/btkobject.c:
	  implemented and object reference tracer (btk_trace_referencing) which
	  is activated if BTK_TRACE_OBJECTS is defined (currently per default).
	  in gdb: set the static variable `btk_trace_object' to point to the
	  object that you want to have reference traced.

	* btk/btkfileselection.c: few cleanups.

	* btk/btkcolorsel.c:

	* btk/btkobject.h: macro cleanups, added BTK_DESTROYED flag.

	* btk/btkobject.c: only emit DESTROY signal if !BTK_OBJECT_DESTROYED
 	  (object).

	* btk/btkprivate.h: new file that will not be automatically included.
	  it holds the private flags for BtkWidget along with it's SET/UNSET
	  and examination macros.

	* btk/btkwidget.c: private flags: BTK_RESIZE_NEEDED, BTK_REDRAW_PENDING,
	  BTK_RESIZE_PENDING, BTK_IN_REPARENT, BTK_USER_STYLE. BTK_ANCHORED is
 	  replaced by BTK_TOPLEVEL. added missing UNSET for BTK_IN_REPARENT.
 	  removed the btk_widget_set_parent(, NULL) hack for toplevels.
	  upon destroy free memory for widgets with BTK_WIDGET_HAS_SHAPE_MASK.

	* btk/btkwidget.h: split up the widget flags into a public and a private

	  new function btk_signal_connect_object_while_alive, which
	  will automatically destroy the connection once one of the objects
	  is destroyed. didn't include this before removal of the above
	  mentioned bug.

Sat Jan 31 21:26:27 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btkwidget.c: Added a new BTK_IN_REPARENT flag and revised
	  btk_widget_reparent so that the child would not be unrealized
	  unnecessarily. Changed btk_widget_unrealize () to recursively
	  unrealize the children (since the child windows will be 
	  destroyed too.)

Sat Jan 31 00:05:34 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* btk/btkcombo.c: changed to use g_strcasecmp
	* btk/btkobject.c: #include <stdlib.h> for atexit

Sat Jan 31 00:13:33 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btkstyle.c: Backed out change to close polygons
	  since it caused problems for the Notebook.

Fri Jan 30 22:28:09 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btkclist.{c,h}:
	   - Conformity to new reference counting schemes
	   - Font and color information is no-longer taken from
	     the (possibly unitialized) style before the widget
	     is realized, but is obtained when needed. (Fixes
	     problems with non-default styles)
	   - white_gc => base_gc where appropriate
	   - Handle graphics expose events correctly (or as
	     correctly as anywhere else) so that scrolling when
	     overlapped works.

Fri Jan 30 21:32:11 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btkwidget.c (btk_widget_init): Don't replace the object
	flags, augment them. (Otherwise we'll clear the FLOATING flag)

	  replaced occourances of btk_widget_destroy with btk_widget_unparent.
	  reference children that are in the selection list.

	* btk/btkmain.c: reference grab widgets.
	  (btk_get_event_widget): check for event.window != NULL. Note: this
 	  function may return NULL now!.
	  (btk_propagate_event): much simplified by using proper reference
 	  counting.

	* btk/btkmenu.c: introduce BTK_TOPLEVEL, and btk_widget_set_parent(,
	  NULL) hack.

	* btk/btkmenuitem.c: btk_widget_(un)ref the submenu.

	* btk/btkmenushell.c: check for return value of btk_get_event_widget.

	* btk/btknotebook.c: proper btk_widget_unparent()ing.

 	  btk_object_notify_weaks, btk_object_debug, btk_object_sink,
 	  btk_object_weakref, btk_object_weakunref. implementation of the new
	  reference counting scheme for btkobjects (consult btk+/REFCOUNTING).

	* btk/btkoptionmenu.c: proper reference counting for option_menu->menu.

	* btk/btkscrolledwindow.c: new finalize handler for proper referencing
	  of the subwidgets.

	* btk/btksignal.c: internal representation of signal_type is now 16 bit
	  instead of 13 bits. this is needed because of user signals.
	  new functions btk_signal_handler_ref and btk_signal_handler_unref
 	  (replacement for btk_signal_handler_destroy).
	  btk_signal_emit, btk_signal_emit_by_name, btk_signal_real_emit used
 	  to return the existence of a BtkObject. this will always be TRUE now,
	  therefore the return value is now void.

	* btk/btktooltips.h:
	* btk/btktooltips.c: BtkTooltips is now a descendant of BtkData and
	  therefore a real BtkObject.

	* btk/btktree.c: reference changes similar to thos in btklist.c.

	* btk/btktreeitem.c: reference th e pixmaps properly.

	* btk/btktypeutils.h:

	  new functions btk_widget_idle_draw and btk_widget_idle_sizer, that
	  will handle all widgets that are currently in either queue.
	  referencing all over the place. changes because btk_signal_emit
 	  returns void now. moved queue removal into the destroy handler.
	  btk_widget_real_unrealize propagates now down the tree. new flag
	  BTK_TOPLEVEL. new function btk_widget_destroyed for connection to the
	  destroy signal of a widget. this function nullifies the widgets
	  structure pointer, look at btkmain.c for an example on this.

	* btk/btkwindow.c: new functions btk_window_activate_focus,
	  btk_window_activate_default. for activation of the appropriate
	  children. changes to the resizing code because there is a new
	  field resize_widgets in BtkContainer now.

	* btk/testbtk.c: some changes because of all the above ;)

Fri Jan 30 17:41:06 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* btk/btktable.c: fixed round-off error in calculation
	  of tabels with a lot of cells

Fri Jan 30 08:51:16 1998  Federico Mena  <federico@bananoid.nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* bdk/bdkcc.c (bdk_color_context_get_pixel): red/green/blue
 	parameters are now expected to be in [0, 65535], to be consistent
 	with the rest of Bdk.
	(bdk_color_context_get_pixels): Made it use 16-bit color values as
 	well.  Fixed mdist=1000000 buglet (it should start with at least
 	0x1000000).
	(bdk_color_context_get_pixels_incremental): Same as
	bdk_color_context_get_pixels().

Thu Jan 29 22:57:39 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btkstyle.c (btk_default_draw_polygon): Close
	  the polygon if it isn't already. (To match btk_draw_polygon)
	  Simplified logic. (Appearance could probably be
	  improved for objects with gradual curves by adding in
	  some intermediate edge coloration)

Thu Jan 29 21:36:14 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gimp.org>

	* btk/btksignal.c (btk_signal_query): new function to gather
 	  information about a certain signal.

	* btk/btksignal.c (btk_signal_newv): new function similar to
 	  btk_signal_new().

	* btk/btksignal.c (btk_signal_real_emit): check for function_offset
	  == 0.

	* btk/btksignal.c (btk_signal_connect_by_type): perform a signal
	  id lookup on the parent as well.

	* btk/btkobject.c (btk_object_class_add_user_signal): new
	  function for implementation of user defined signals.
	* btk/btkobject.c (btk_object_class_add_signals): free old
	  signal id array.

	* btk/btkobject.h: this holds the typedefs for BtkSignalFunc and
	  BtkSignalMarshaller now, because they are used for
	  btk_object_class_add_user_signal.

	* btk/btktypeutils.c (btk_type_class_init): reset object_class->signals
	  and object_class->nsignals for new object classes.

Tue Jan 27 15:52:48 1998  Federico Mena  <federico@bananoid.nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* btk/btkhandlebox.c (btk_handle_box_realize): The auto_shrink
	policy of the floating window is now set to TRUE.  This fixes the
	problem of the floating window being too big when the handlebox
	child is small.
	(btk_handle_box_motion): Now we use BDK_POINTER_MOTION_HINT_MASK
	to improve movement.

Tue Jan 27 14:15:50 CST 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

        * docs/btkfaq.sgml: more additions/changes Tony Gale.

Mon Jan 26 17:12:12 CST 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* docs/btkfaq.sgml: additions/changes from new FAQ maintainers
          Nathan Froyd and Tony Gale.

Mon Jan 26 16:54:02 CST 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* docs/btk.texi: additions/changes from Gregory A. McLean

Mon Jan 26 02:15:29 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gimp.org>

	* bdk/bdkdraw.c:
	* bdk/bdkgc.c:
	* bdk/bdkimage.c:
	* bdk/bdkinput.c:
	* bdk/bdkpixmap.c:
	* bdk/bdkproperty.c:
	* bdk/bdkselection.c:
	* bdk/bdkwindow.c: added a bunch of checks for window != NULL and
	  private->destroyed.

Sun Jan 25 19:15:32 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gimp.org>

	* btk/btkwidget.h (enum): added new widget flag BTK_LEAVE_PENDING.
	* btk/btkmain.c (btk_main_iteration_do): if a widget has
 	  BTK_LEAVE_PENDING set, send it its LEAVE_NOTIFY event, regardless
 	  of a grab or sensitivity.
	  changed the compression code for enter/leave notify events to
	  free *both* compressed event, and removed an unneccessary call
	  to g_list_remove.

	* ChangeLog: finally catched up with the recent changes on my part.

	* btk/btkobject.h: new element n_args in BtkObjectClass.
	* btk/btkobject.c (btk_object_query_args): this function now returns
 	  the arguments in the correct order.

        * btk/btkbox.c:
 	* btk/btkbutton.c:
 	* btk/btkcontainer.c:
 	* btk/btkframe.c:
	* btk/btklabel.c:
 	* btk/btkobject.c:
 	* btk/btkwidget.c:
 	* btk/btkwindow.c: various fixes and additions to the btk_*_set_arg
 	  and btk_*_get_arg() functions.

	* bdk/bdk.h:
	* bdk/bdk.c (bdk_pointer_is_grabbed): new function.

	* btk/btkmain.h:
	* btk/btkmain.c: implementations of btk_invoke_key_snoopers(),
	  btk_key_snooper_install() and btk_key_snooper_remove(). this
	  mechanism allowes applications to track global hot keys that need
 	  to bypass accelerator tables and else key processing stuff.

Thu Jan 22 18:58:44 1998  Federico Mena  <federico@bananoid.nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* bdk/bdkcc.c: Switched the file to GNU indentation, for consistency.

	* bdk/bdktypes.h (struct _BdkColorContext): Picky, picky... fix
	two lines with wrong indentation :-)

Thu Jan 22 02:32:06 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* btk/Makefile.am: Fixed the call to runelisp to use $(SHELL).
  	  (Cannot rely on the script having execute permissions.)

Wed Jan 21 17:29:54 CST 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* Released 0.99.3

Wed Jan 21 01:32:21 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@psynet.net>

	* btk/btkwidget.h:
	* btk/btkwidget.c: changed the state_changed signal to take an
 	  extra argument `old_state'.
	  removed `btk_widget_restore_state'.
	  changed `btk_widget_set_state' and `btk_widget_set_sensitive' to use
	  only one function `btk_widget_propagate_state' to iterate down the
	  tree. this causes BtkWidget::state_changed to be invoked on state
	  changes and on sensitivity changes. some comment cleanups.

Tue Jan 20 16:38:52 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>
	* btk/btkcombobox.{c,h}: removed
	  btk/btkcombo.{c,h}: added [Paolo Molaro's version]
	  btk/testbtk.c: changed to use new version
	  btk/Makefile.am btk/btk.h
	
Mon Jan 19 20:10:19 CST 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* bdk/bdk.h Fixed typo where strdup was used instead of g_strdup
          (found by Frank Neumann)

Mon Jan 19 16:21:00 1998  Federico Mena  <federico@bananoid.nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* btk/btktoolbar.c (btk_toolbar_class_init): Set
	container_class->focus to NULL.  Widgets in the toolbar should not
	get the focus via the normal key bindings (no toolkit does this,
	and it makes sense).

	* btk/testbtk.c (create_toolbar): Removed the BTK_PIXMAP casts to
	match Eckehard's new prototypes.

	* btk/btktoolbar.h: Switched the order of the tooltip_text and
	widget parameters to the btk_toolbar_*_widget() functions, to be
	friendlier to the C++ bindings.  This is per request of Guillaume
	Laurent.

Mon Jan 19 09:16:38 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@psynet.net>

	* btk/btkmain.c (btk_grab_add) (btk_grab_remove): this is a stack
 	  of grabbing widgets now, having unique entries. the BTK_HAS_GRAB
	  flag of a widget is set while it is on the stack (wasn't
	  implemented before).

Mon Jan 19 00:46:18 1998 MET  Eckehard Berns  <eb@berns.prima.de>

	* btk/btktoolbar.[ch]: changed
 	  btk_toolbar_{append,prepend,inser]_item to accept any BtkWidget
 	  as icon to allow more flexibility

Sun Jan 18 16:54:55 CST 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>
	* btk/btkstatusbar.[ch] added new widget, the statusbar

Sun Jan 18 09:57:00 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btkbutton.c btk/btkclist.c btk/btkdrawingarea.c
	  btk/btkentry.c btk/btkeventbox.c btk/btkfixed.c
	  btk/btkhandlebox.c btk/btkhscale.c btk/btkhscrollbar.c
	  btk/btkitem.c btk/btklist.c btk/btkmenushell.c btk/btkmisc.c
	  btk/btknotebook.c btk/btkpaned.c btk/btkpreview.c
	  btk/btkprogressbar.c btk/btkruler.c btk/btktext.c btk/btktree.c
	  btk/btkviewport.c btk/btkvscale.c btk/btkvscrollbar.c
	  btk/btkwidget.{c,h}

	Added btk_widget_set_parent_window() and 
	btk_widget_get_parent_window(). All widgets should use:
	
	   btk_widget_get_parent_window() instead of widget->parent->window.
	
	Any widget that wants to have children not in the parent window,
	should use btk_widget_set_parent() in their realize() and
	add() routines. 

	CList and Viewport widgets changed to do this. (Viewport
	widget using code from btk-fortier-980117-0.patch.)

Sat Jan 17 23:56:02 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* btk/btkobject.c:
	   renamed g_string_equal => g_str_equal
	   renamed g_string_hash => g_str_hash

Sun Jan 18 03:57:52 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@psynet.net>

	* btk/btkframe.c: btk_*_get_arg() and btk_*_set_arg() implementations.
	* btk/btkobject.c: new arg `BtkObject::object_signal' similar to
	  `BtkObject::signal'. check for class type in btk_object_{setv|getv}.

	* btk/btkobject.c:
	* btk/btksignal.c:
	* btk/btktypeutils.h:
	* btk/btktypeutils.c: added BTK_TYPE_DOUBLE.

	* btk/btkwidget.c: new args `has_focus' and `has_default'.
	* btk/btkwindow.c: new arg `window_position'.

	* btk/btkbox.h:
	* btk/btkbox.c: new functions btk_box_reorder_child,
	btk_box_query_child_packing and btk_box_set_child_packing to
	allow modification of the child linkage after the widget tree
	is setup.

	* btk/btkbox.c:
        * btk/btklabel.c:
        * btk/btkwindow.c:
	* btk/btkwidget.c:
        * btk/btkobject.c: btk_*_get_arg() and btk_*_set_arg() fixes
          and implementations.
	
Sat Jan 17 18:06:35 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>
	* bdk/bdk.c (bdk_events_pending): Take putback events into
	  account

	* bdk/bdk.c (bdk_event_free): Handle dropdataavaible memory
	  allocation correctly. (Incompatible change: client must
	  _not_ fre event->data and event->data_type.)

	* bdk/bdk.c (bdk_event_translate): Changed DND dragging
	  so that we don't ungrab pointer when we reenter window
	  to prevent extra Enter/Leave effects which had bad
	  effects.
          Changed drag zone handling to not send uncessary
	  DragEnter events.
          Fixed EnterNotify/LeaveNotify handling. (Only pay
	  attention to events on window, don't specify these
	  events to XGrabPointer - that isn't valid, and handle
          reverse the sense of the handling of LeaveNotify.)

	* bdk/bdkwindow.c (bdk_window_remove_filter): Free removed
	  filter.

	* btk/btk.defs (BdkFont): bdk_font_free => bdk_font_unref

	* btk/btkmain.{c,h} (btk_events_pending): new function - apps
	  should use this instead of bdk_events_pending.

	* btk/btkvbbox.h: Fixed a duplication in the headers.

	* btk/testbtk.c (dnd_drop): Don't free the drop data,
	  it belongs to the event.

Sat Jan 17 13:26:15 CST 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* btk/btkentry.[ch]:  Applied patch from <lupus@lettere.unipd.it> 
          which adds btk_entry_set_max_length function.  This was 
          part of btk-lupus-970112-0.

	* btk/testbtk.c: Applied btk-wille-980113-0 which fixes 
          a problem with a shaped widget keeping grab forever
          when double clicked.
     
        * docs/btk.texi: patch from Gregory McLean <gregm@randomc.com>
          to add some on aspect_frame, button_box, and color_selection
          widgets

Sat Jan 17 06:24:05 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@psynet.net>

	* btk/btktypeutils.h (btk_type_get_arg): new function.
	* btk/btkobject.h (btk_object_query_args): new function.
	* btk/btkobject.h (btk_object_getv): new function.
	* btk/btkwidget.h (btk_widget_get): new function.

Fri Jan 16 00:36:31 1998  Federico Mena  <federico@bananoid.nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* btk/btkhandlebox.c: Now we use a BtkWindow of type
	BTK_WINDOW_DIALOG as a destination for reparenting the child of
	the handle box.  This solves the problem of having X calls in
	Btk.  It also makes the handle box work with KWM, OLVWM, 4Dwm (so
	I expect mwm to work as well).  I hadn't noticed that previously
	it only worked with fvwm and twm.

	* btk/btkhandlebox.h (struct _BtkHandleBox): Removed the
	real_parent field, as it is never used.
	(struct _BtkHandleBox): Added a float_window field.  This is a
	BtkWindow to where the child is now reparented.

	* btk/btkhandlebox.c: Lots of changes all over the place.  Now the
	widget has two windows.  The steady_window stays put in the parent
	container, and the widget->window is the one that gets
	reparented.  Now that window is transient, in compliance with the
	ICCCM, instead of an OverrideRedirect window.

	We have two windows so that we can properly receive Expose events
	for the thin 3D line that marks the place where the handlebox is
	docked.

	* btk/btkhandlebox.h (struct _BtkHandleBox): Added fields for
	dragging (mouse position information).  Added fleur_cursor so that
	we look pretty.  Added steady_window field; it is the window that
	actually stays on the parent (widget->window is the one that gets
	reparented).

Thu Jan 15 19:03:19 1998  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* btk/btkclist.c (btk_clist_set_column_width): Call
	btk_clist_size_allocate_columns every time the column
	configuration changes. 

Fri Jan 16 01:55:17 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@psynet.net>

	* improved the btk_widget_set handling. removed BtkArgFunc and added
	  BtkArgSetFunc and BtkArgGetFunc in _BtkTypeInfo.
	  performance consuming strcmp() calls are avoided in btk_*_set_arg()
	  now, it is passed an arg_id on which it can switch() now.

	* btk/btkobject.h:
	* btk/btkobject.c (btk_object_add_arg_type): added parameter arg_id.

	* btk/btktypeutils.h:
	* btk/btktypeutils.c (btk_type_set_arg): added parameter arg_id.

	* btk/btkobject.c: bug fixes and changes in the assertion system for
	  arg handling. changed g_print() warning calls to real g_warning()s.
	  
	* changed all *_get_type() functions to initialize BtkTypeInfo
	  correctly with BtkArgSetFunc and BtkArgGetFunc fields.

Thu Jan 15 00:44:27 PST 1998 Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>
	* btk/btkentry.[ch]: Change window cursor to "I"
	* btk/btkpane.[ch]: Cleared up a tiny memory leak from not destroying the
	cursor

Tue Jan 13 07:30:02 PST 1998 Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>
	* btk/btkclist.c: minor updates
	* btk/btktext.c: you can type in it!  It should also seg-fault *MUCH* less now,
	because editing was never really turned off.  
	* btk/testbtk.c: changed the btktext test a little
	* btk/testbtkrc: removed pixmap background for now, since I intend to break
	that for a while

1998-01-13  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* btk/btktoolbar.c: (btk_real_toolbar_style_changed): Fixed
	child->icon and child->label == NULL bugs.

	* btk/btktoolbar.h: Added some new functions:
		btk_toolbar_append_widget()
		btk_toolbar_prepend_widget()
		btk_toolbar_insert_widget()
	These let the user insert any kind of widget in the toolbar.  Also
	changed the btk_toolbar_*_item() functions to return a
	BtkWidget * so that the user can do things with the toolbar buttons.

	* btk/btktoolbar.c: Now the toolbar supports its own buttons and
	arbitrary widgets as well.  Geometry management has been changed
	accordingly.  Added btk_toolbar_remove() function, so container
	functionality should be complete now.

	* btk/testbtk.c (create_toolbar): Added an entry widget to test
	the new toolbar.

	* Most of these changes are adapted from the
	btk-lupus-970112-0-patch (should be 970112... :-)

Sat Jan  9 20:52:00 PST 1998 Ian Main <imain@gimp.org>
	* btk/btkfilesel.c:  Changed a few tests in the path correcting
		function.  Hopefully this helps the filesel stability.

Fri Jan  8 00:55:00 PST 1998 Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>
	* btk/btkclist.c:
	* btk/btkclist.h: modifications to BtkCList so it's look and 
	feel is the same as scrolled windows.

Thu Jan  8 17:56:09 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* bunnylib/gscanner.c
	* btk/gtclist.c
	* config.h.in
	* configure.in: added test for inline and put the inline keywords
	back in

	* btk/btklabel.c: made the prototypes match the definitions

	* btk/fnmatch.c: minor change to make sure the right config.h
	gets included
	
1998-01-07  Elliot Lee  <sopwith@localhost.cs.cuc.edu>

	* btk/btkcombobox.c btk/btkcombobox.h: New widget, BtkComboBox
	* bdk/bdkwindow.c: Make bdk_window_init set the width &
		height of bdk_root_parent

Wed Jan  7 18:06:17 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* btk/btkentry.c:
	* btk/btkentry.h: applied patch to use a backing pixmap for
	drawing, which removes the bad flickering. (btk-wille-980106-0)

Wed Jan  7 02:14:30 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* bunnylib/bunnylib.h

	* btk/btknotebook.h btk/btknotebook.c
	   Added "switch_page" signal. (btk-hamann_jeske-971212-0.patch)

Tue Jan  6 17:07:29 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>
	* btk/btkentry.c btk/btkentry.h btk/testbtk.c : 
	   Fixed problem with deleting while text is selected.
	   Changed behavior so that motion keys remove selection.
	   Added new btk_entry_select_rebunnyion () call.

Sat Jan  3 20:23:25 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>
	* bunnylib/bunnylib.h: Changed buint32 -> buint for bitfields. 
	  (Bitfields must be int or unsigned int?)

Sat Jan  3 15:39:45 PST 1998 Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>
	* btk/testbtk.c: better CList test

Sat Jan  3 11:09:51 CST 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>
	* BTK+ 0.99.2 Released

Sat Jan  3 11:09:51 CST 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* btk/btkscrolledwindow.c: initialize scrollbar_spacing
	  (btk-fortier-980103-0)

Sat Jan  3 10:15:08 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* configure.in: fixed a typo (no_xext_lib, not no_ext_lib).

Sat Jan  3 00:41:28 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* btk/btkentry.c:
	* btk/btkentry.h: applied Gordon Matzigkeit's patch to add
	fixed-length entry fields (btk_entry_new_with_max_length)
	
Fri Jay  2 23:52 PST 1998 Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>
	* reverted bunnylibconfig.h and bunnylib.h files back to the
	way they were before my ugly hack
	* btk/btkclist.c:
	* bunnylib/gscanner.c: removed inlines from clist and gscanner

Fri Jan  2 23:55:24 CST 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* Several portability fixes from Michael Callahan 
          <callahan@xmission.com> including adding in missing
 	  #includes and adding void in function prototypes.

Fri Jan  2 19:28:52 1988 Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>
	* btk/btkclist.h:
	* btk/btkclist.c:
	* btk/btk.h:
	* btk/testbtk.c:
	* btk/testbtkrc: added BtkCList, column list widget, and a small test
	to testbtk

Fri Jan  2 15:42:51 1998  Federico Mena  <federico@bananoid.nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* btk/btkmain.c (btk_main_iteration): Make the big switch handle
	BDK_NO_EXPOSE and BDK_VISIBILITY_NOTIFY events.

Fri Jan  2 12:07:33 CST 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gimp.org>

	* btk/btkviewport.c: corrects a small resize bug in the 
          viewport widget.  The viewport widget provides a _set_shadow 
          function to draw its shadows. But if BTK_SHADOW_NONE is sent 
          to this function, the viewport isn't resized correctly (it's 
          still considered as a shadowed widget).  (btk-fortier-971213-0)

	* btk/btknotebook.c: this patch fixes the redraw problems of 
          notebook tabs, without using bdk_gc_set_clip_rectangle.
          (btk-hamann_jeske-971218-0)

	btk/btkaspectframe.c:
	Some minor improvements to rounding in aspectframes.
	Make sure that child allocation is always >= 0
	Always trigger size allocation with btk_widget_queue_resize
	to prevent calling size_allocate before allocation done.

Mon Nov 24 1997 Owen Taylor <owt1@cornell.edu>
	btk/btkframe.c:
	Changed tests for drawability to BTK_WIDGET_DRAWABLE
	Always trigger size allocation with btk_widget_queue_resize
	to prevent calling size_allocate before allocation done.

Mon Nov 24 1997 Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>
	btk-dairiki-971117-2.patch
	btk/btkaspectframe.c (btk_aspect_frame_size_allocate): When
	computing new dimensions of the subwidget, round to nearest
	integer rather than truncating.

Mon Nov 24 1997 Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>
	btk-dairiki-971117-1.patch
	* btk/btkvruler.c (btk_vruler_draw_ticks):
	* btk/btkhruler.c (btk_hruler_draw_ticks): Ensure that subticks
 	always are drawn when they should be (sometimes they were getting
 	drawn with zero length --- invisible).  Also clear rectangle
 	behind text labels to ensure they don't touch or overlap ticks. 

Mon Nov 24 1997 Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>
	* btk/btkaspectframe.c (btk_aspect_frame_set): 
	btk-dairiki-971117-0.patch
	Clear window when aspect ratio or alignment is changed.

Mon Nov 24 1997 Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>
	* btk/btkobject.h: fixed BTK_OBJECT_NSIGNALS macro

Mon Nov 24 1997 Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>
	* btk/btklabel.h: modified btklabel to clip its drawing to
	its given area, now it will always draw in the area it's 
	been given and clip accordingly.  Note: this may cause
	the a label to disappear on widgets which don't give their
	child labels proper area!

Mon, 17 Nov 1997 Michael K. Johnson <johnsonm@redhat.com>
	* btkwidget.c: btk_set_style_recurse was not allowing updated
	widget names to cause new styles to be applied.
	* btkentry.c btkentry.h: The entry widget now has invisible
	attribute.  The cursor does not move to show you typing; this
	is an intentional design decision but I'm not so attached to it
	that I'll reverse any patches that change it...  :-)

	This patch is a modified version of a patch to which I have
	lost the attribution.  I modified it by packing the "visible"
	flag into the structure more tightly (without damaging backwards
	compatibility on sane systems) and by allowing entry timers
	to run.

Mon Nov 17 1997 Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>
	* btkviewport.c: Raph's Mon, 10 Nov 1997 patch to btk-list 
	to fix some viewport bugs

Mon Nov 17 1997 Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>
	* btk/btkwidget.c: btk-ajaborsk-971016-2
	A little patch again to prevent user to use btk_widget_set_events()
	when a widget is already realized.
	In this case, the btk_widget_set_events() doesn't work.

Mon Nov 17 1997 Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>
	* btk/btkwindow.c: btk-ajaborsk-971016-1
	This small patch correct position for BTK_WIN_POS_CENTER and
	BTK_WIN_POS_MOUSE BtkWindow positions.

Sat Nov 15 1997 Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>
	* bdk/bdkgc.c: added function bdk_gc_set_clip_rectangle
	* bdk/bdk.h: header for above

Sat Nov 15 1997 Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>
	* bdk/bdkgc.c: added function bdk_gc_set_clip_rectangle
	* bdk/bdk.h: header for above

Wed Nov 12 1997 Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>
	* bdk/bdkpixmap.c: Patrice Fortier's patch for transparent pixmaps.
	* bdk/bdk.h:
	  bdk/bdkdraw.c: Patrice Fortier's patch to add pixel draw function.

Sun Nov  9 1997 Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>
	* Fixed problems with makefiles relating to the bug
	which required bunnylib to be installed.
	* Fixed makefiles to incluce the xpm's in btk+/btk needed
	for testbtk.
	* Updated btk+ and btk+/bunnylib to libtool-1.0f

Fri Nov  7 1997 Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>
	* btk/btktext.c: return char_widths[ch & 0xff]; in line 2152

Thr Nov  5 1997 Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>
	* btk/testbtk.c: added drag and drop test, removed the test hack
	from the button test

Tue Nov  4 08:28:57 1997  Federico Mena  <federico@bananoid.nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* btk/btkmain.c (btk_handle_idle): Patch from David Mosberger to
	avoid crashes when handling idle function (this manifested itself
	in the Umax and Microtek backends in SANE.

Sun Nov  2 07:34:56 1997  Tim Janik  <timj@psynet.net>

	* btk/btkfilesel.c: Small fixes about a segmentation viaolation
	cause by a double click in the directoy list (introduced by my
	previous changes).
	
	* btk/btklist.c: Small fixes to btk_list_add() and btk_list_remove().
	
	* btk/testbtk.c (list_add): Applied Stefan Wille's patch to make this
	function do something ;).

Fri Oct 31 Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>
	*bdk/bdk.c: reformatted DND code for BTK coding standards
	*bdk/bdkwindow.c: changed memory allocation for DND to q_mem stuff

Thu Oct 30 Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>
	* bdk/bdkwindow.c: 
	* bdk/bdk/bdk.h:
	* btk/btkwidget.h:
	* btk/btkwidget.c: Applied Stephan Willie's shaped window patch

	* bdk/bdkwindow: 
	* bdk/bdk.h:
	* btk/btkwidget.h:
 	* btk/btkwidget.c: reformatted the DND code to conform to BTK
		coding standards

	* btk/testbtk: massive fixes, SW's shaped window example

Thu Oct 30 07:33:27 1997  Tim Janik  <timj@psynet.net>

	* btk/btklistitem.c (btk_real_list_item_toggle): applied Johannes
	Keukelaar's <johannes@nada.kth.se> patch for keyboard support in
	BtkList widgets.

	* btk/btkfilesel.c: adapted dir and file list selection
	behaviour to deal with keyboard selections. this is a little
	bit tricky: in the dir list it just changes the entrys value on a one
	button press. but on a keyboard selection via btk_widget_activate() it
	does a new population (likewise on a double click) as this seems more
	obvious.

1997-10-25  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* bdk/bdkcolor.c (bdk_colormap_get_system): Initialize
	private->ref_count.

Wed Oct 22 09:47:43 1997  Tim Janik  <timj@psynet.net>

	* btk/btkwindow.c (btk_window_key_release_event): Fixed a stupid
	bug that caused the key_release_event to be propagated twice.

Sun Oct 12 11:01:43 1997  Tim Janik  <timj@psynet.net>

        * acconfig.h:
        * configure.in:
	* bdk/bdkimage.c: Added configure check for IPC_RMID_DEFERRED_RELEASE,
	because shmat() fails after a shmctl(..., IPC_RMID,...) for OSF1 V3.2,
	SunOS 4.1.1, 5.5, 5.5.1, 5.6, IRIX 5.2 and 6.2.

Mon Oct  6 11:59:07 1997  Federico Mena  <federico@bananoid.nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* bdk/bdk.c (bdk_event_translate): In line 1693, fixed typo that
	would cause motion notify events not to be delivered.

Sun Oct  5 18:15:06 1997  Federico Mena  <federico@bananoid.nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* btk/btkrc.c (btk_rc_parse_bg_pixmap): Changed strdup() for
 	g_strdup().

Wed Sep 24 17:16:34 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@bjork.inktomi.com>

	* configure.in: Fixed a stupid error in the test for libXext that
	would cause it to fail if X_EXTRA_LIBS was not empty.

	* btk/btkmain.h (btk-timj-970919.patch):
	* btk/btkmain.c (btk-timj-970919.patch): new function
 	`btk_idle_remove_by_data' to remove all idle callbacks that take a
 	specific piece of data as argument.  (btk_get_current_event):
 	remove idles through btk_idle_remove_by_data.
        
	* btk/btkwidget.c (btk-timj-970919.patch):
        (btk_widget_destroy): remove pending idles for
        widgets that have BTK_REDRAW_PENDING or BTK_RESIZE_PENDING and
        BTK_ANCHORED set (only anchored widgets can have a resize queue
        handler pending). widgets that have BTK_RESIZE_NEEDED will be removed
        from their anchored toplevels `resize_widgets' list.
        
        (btk_widget_queue_draw): let the widget remember the queue handler
        tag (through `redraw_handler_key') for later call to `btk_idle_remove'.
        
        (btk_widget_queue_resize): let the widget remember the queue handler
        tag (through `resize_handler_key') for later call to `btk_idle_remove'.
        corrected referencing the toplevel widget for which the handler is
        pending. if a widget is added to the `resize_widgets' list of a
        toplevel widget, BTK_RESIZE_NEEDED is set and it's referenced.
        
        (btk_real_widget_queue_resize): on the deletion of the `resize_widgets'
        list, unset BTK_RESIZE_NEEDED and unreference the removed widgets.
        
	* btk/btkwindow.c (btk-timj-970919.patch):
        (btk_real_window_move_resize): move `resize_containers = NULL'
        initialization out of if-statement.
        while stepping through the `resize_widgets' list, unreference the
        widgets and clear BTK_RESIZE_NEEDED. if a widget realy needs are
        resize, they are flagged through BTK_RESIZE_NEEDED now (instead of
        BTK_RESIZE_PENDING, as this is indicative for a pending handler).
        added checks to provide segfaulting if a widgets parent pointer
        is NULL (e.g. on toplevel widgets that have BTK_RESIZE_NEEDED set).

Tue Sep 23 13:23:27 1997  Federico Mena  <federico@bananoid.nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* bdk/bdkimage.c: Applied Tim Janik's patch to mark shm segments
	as IPC_RMID so that they are automatically removed always.

	* bdk/bdkfont.c: Removed casts from lvalues.

	* btk/btkmain.c: Removed BTK_RETLOC_*() (which do a cast) from lvalues.

	* btk/btkaccelerator.c (btk_accelerator_table_remove): Added
	"const" to the accelerator_key param to be consistent with the
	declaration in btkaccelerator.h.  The const is not useful in this
	case, anyway.

Tue Sep 16 13:11:06 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@bjork.inktomi.com>

	* btkpreview.c: Andrew Logan Kieschnick's change to eliminate
	round-off error when gamma is set to 1.0.

	* btkrange.c:
	* btkviewport.c: Jay Painter's changes to modify the way in which
	viewports resize.

	* bdkinput.c:
	* bdkinputgxi.h:
	* bdkinputxfree.h:
	* btk/Makefile.am:
	* btk.h:
	* btkeventbox.c:
	* btkeventbox.h: Owen Taylor's event box widget and fixes for X
	input support (that I had broken).

	* bdk.h:
	* bdkwindow.c:
	* btksignal.h:
	* btksignal.c: Elliot Lee's changes to support Objective C. (id is
	apparently a reserved word in Objective C).

Sun Sep 14 22:33:15 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkwidget.c (btk_widget_queue_resize): If the toplevel container
	is invisible we simply call "btk_container_need_resize" on
	it. This fixes a bug with option menus not redrawing correctly.

	* btkmenuitem.c (btk_menu_item_enter): (btk_menu_item_leave):
	These functions now simply pass the event on to their parent. This
	is necessary for menus to work properly due to the change in how
	grabs are dealts with.

	* btkwindow.c (btk_real_window_move_resize): Fixed a bug that
	caused the BTK_RESIZE_PENDING flag to not be unset in some cases.

Fri Sep  5 20:49:37 1997  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	Bug fixes:

	* Makefile.am: Added PATCHES to EXTRA_DIST.
	* btk/btkpixmap.c (btk_pixmap_new): Move the "pixmap != NULL" test
 	after the allocation of the pixmap.

	To shut up the compiler:

	* btk/btkfilesel.c (get_pwdb): Initialize home_dir.
	* btk/btkmain.c (btk_init): Replace comments around calls to
 	g_set_*_handler with "if (0)".
	* btk/btkrc.c (btk_rc_get_token): Initialize hex_number and
 	float_number.
	* btk/btkwindow.c (btk_window_key_press_event): Initialize
 	direction.

	Changes to the type system in btk/:

	* Makefile.am: Added btktypebuiltins.h to btkinclude_HEADERS.
  	Added btk.defs, runelisp, gentypeinfo.el and btktypebuiltins.c to
 	EXTRA_DIST.  Added rules to generate btktypebuiltins.* from
 	btk.defs.

	* runelisp, gentypeinfo.el, btk.defs: New files.

	* btkaccelerator.c, btkaccelerator.h (btk_accelerator_table_ref):
 	Return the table so that this function can be used as the `copy'
 	function for BTK_TYPE_BOXED values.
	* btkstyle.c, btkstyle.h (btk_style_ref): Likewise.

	* btkenums.h: Removed BtkArgType enum.

	* btkmain.c (btk_init): Call btk_type_init to initialize the type
 	system.

	* btkobject.c (btk_object_init_type): New function to take over
 	for btk_object_get_type. (btk_object_get_type): Just return the
 	constant BTK_TYPE_OBJECT. (btk_object_collect_args): Do the right
 	thing for the new BTK_TYPE_* types.
	* btksignal.c (btk_params_get): Likewise.

	* btktypeutils.c: (btk_type_init_builtin_types): New
 	function. (btk_type_init): Call it.  Also made non-static.
	(btk_type_unique): The allocation scheme for numerical ids has
 	changed: The low 8 bits hold the appropriate BtkFundamentalType of
 	a type, the rest is a globally unique sequence number.
  	(btk_type_hash): Use the sequence number of a key to hash it.
  	(btk_type_register_builtin): New function.

	* btktypeutils.h: (BtkFundamentalType): New enumeration of the
 	fundamental types. (BTK_TYPE_MAKE, BTK_FUNDAMENTAL_TYPE,
 	BTK_TYPE_SEQNO): New macros to work with the new id scheme.
	(BtkArg): Added fields for new types and renamed old ones.  BtkArg
 	should now be a mostly opaque structure, except name and type.
	(BTK_VALUE_*): New macros to access the values of a BtkArg.
	(BTK_RETLOC_*): New macros to access the location of a return
 	value that is contained in a BtkArg.  * btktypebuiltins.h: New
 	file to access the typeids of the builtin types.

	* btkwidget.h (BTK_TYPE_WIDGET): New macro to access the type id
 	of the widget class.

	Thru out: Changed BTK_ARG_* to the appropriate BTK_TYPE_*.
  	Changed access to BtkArg structure to the appropriate BTK_VALUE_*
 	or BTK_RETLOC_* macro.  Changed BtkArgType to BtkType.  Changed
 	some buints to BtkType.

	General changes in btk/ to support interpreters:

	* btkradiobutton.c (btk_radio_button_new_from_widget,
 	btk_radio_button_new_with_label_from_widget): New functions.

	* btksignal.c (btk_signal_connect_no_marshal): New function.
	(struct _BtkHandler): Added no_marshal and destroy_func fields.
  	(btk_signal_handler_new): Initialize them.
	(btk_signal_connect_by_type): Added no_marshal and destroy_func
 	arguments.  Changed all callers.
	(btk_signal_destroy): Invoke destroy_func if there is one and the
 	global destroy func does not apply.  (btk_handlers_run): If the
 	handler has no_marshal set, call its function directly without
 	going thru the signal's marshaller.

Wed Sep  3 09:56:22 1997  RHS Linux User  <pmattis@bjork.inktomi.com>

	* btkrange.c: Changed the way the range control focus was drawn so
 	that the range control is drawn correctly when it does not have
	the focus.

Tue Sep  2 17:41:17 1997  RHS Linux User  <pmattis@bjork.inktomi.com>

	* btkwidget.c: 'btk_real_widget_queue_resize' should only remove
	the "resize_widgets" if another resize is not pending.

Mon Sep  1 18:28:08 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkmain.c: Changed the way BDK_DELETE events are handled. Only,
	if 'btk_widget_event' returns TRUE is the widget destroyed. By
	default, 'btk_widget_event' will return FALSE causing the window
	to not be destroyed. This prevents segfaults in the GIMP and other
	programs that do not correctly handle BDK_DELETE events.

	* btkmain.c: Added modal dialog support by allowing events
	destined for a child of the grab widget to go to the child instead
	of the grab widget. (Added 'btk_widget_is_ancestor' to determine
	the relationship between the grab widget and the event widget).

	* *.[ch]: Incorprated a whole mess of patches. (Started keeping
	the ChangeLog up to date again).

Thu Jun  5 17:22:21 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkmenufactory.c:
	* btkmenufactory.h: Added 'btk_menu_factory_remove_*'
	calls. Removing entries/paths causes the associated widgets to be
	destroyed.

	* btkwidget.c:
	* btkwidget.h: Calling 'btk_widget_set_style' is used as an
	indication that the programmer specifically wants that style to be
	used. RC-style substitution is disabled for the widget after such
	a call.

	* btkpixmap.c:
	* btkpixmap.h:
	* btkimage.c:
	* btkimage.h: Changed to use clip mask and a single pixmap (or
	image) to deal with transparent areas.

	* bdkpixmap.c: Modified xpm loading routines to optionally return
	a clip mask.

	* bdkgc.c:
	* bdkdraw.c:
	* bdktypes.h: Modifications to allow clip masks to be used with
	gc's. Clip masks are bitmaps that specify drawable rebunnyions.

Thu May  1 03:11:51 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkscrolledwindow.c: Scrolled windows need to have the
	BTK_NO_WINDOW flag set. Not having it set caused an obscure
	redrawing bug.

Wed Apr 30 12:38:03 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkhruler.c:
	* btkvruler.c: Fixed a small bug that caused the indicator to be
	positioned slightly off.

Sun Apr 27 14:28:21 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkmenushell.c:
	* btkmenushell.h:
	* btkmenu.c:
	* btkmenu.h: Changes so that if a menu is popped up there is a
	timeout period during which a menu item will not be activated and
	if the mouse button is released in that period the menu will stay
	popped up.

	* btkcurve.c:
	* btkcurve.h: Included curve widget courtesy of David
	Mosberger-Tang (davidm@azstarnet.com).

	* btkentry.c:
	* btkentry.h: Changed "insert" and "delete" signals to
	"insert_text" and "delete_text" respectively. (The symbol "delete"
	cannot be used since it is a C++ reserved word).

Sat Apr 19 01:43:49 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkmenufactory.c: A path which ends in "<nothing>" will cause an
	invisible (hidden) menu entry to be created. This is useful for
	setting an accelerator key for which a corresponding menu entry is
	not desired.

	* btktooltips.c: Fixed some problems with destruction of the
	active tip widget not properly updating the tooltips data
	structures.

Fri Apr 18 15:09:45 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkcontainer.c:
	* btklist.c:
	* btkwidget.c:
	* btkwidget.h: Patch from Owen Taylor (owt1@cornell.edu) which
	fixes problems with destruction of objects and with destruction of
	objects which hold the focus.

Thu Apr 17 11:29:15 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkmenushell.c: Incorrect logic in
	'btk_menu_shell_button_release' for deciding when a menu should
	stay popped up when the mouse button is released.

	* *.c: Miscellaneous fixes from folks on the net.

Tue Apr 15 02:43:17 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* *.c:
	* btkwidget.h: Added BTK_BASIC widget flag which when set
	specifies a widget as "basic". A "basic" widget is one which
	doesn't take input events. For example, labels, pixmaps, boxes,
	tables, alignments, etc.

Sat Apr 12 15:23:08 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkcolorsel.c: Add "#include <math.h>" to define M_PI.

	* btksignal.c: Fixed a bug in 'btk_signal_emit' which showed up
	because of the new cast checking macros. The 'object' was being
	accessed after it had been destroyed.

	* btkoptionmenu.c: Fixed bug with using 'BTK_BIN' instead of
	'BTK_BUTTON' which showed up because of the new cast checking
	macros.

	* *.h: 'BTK_CHECK_CAST', 'BTK_CHECK_CLASS_CAST' and
	'BTK_CHECK_TYPE' used by standard widget macros everywhere.

Wed Apr  9 00:54:17 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* docs/btk.texi: Started further work on documentation. Major
	changes and additions are being made.

	* btkarrow.c:
	* btkarrow.h: Removed function 'btk_arrow_get'.

	* btkcontainer.c: 'btk_container_check_resize' no performs
 	additional checking to account for the case where the containers
 	allocation is no longer sufficient because its parent (or its
 	parents parent, etc.) needs to resize its children.

Tue Apr  8 21:15:50 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkstyle.c: Fixed a bug in 'btk_style_init' in which the font
 	was not ref'd (via 'bdk_font_ref'), but was free'd (via in
 	'bdk_font_free') in 'btk_style_destroy'. (David
 	Mosberger-Tang). Also cleaned up 'btk_style_destroy' while I was
 	at it.

	* btkmain.c: Fixed a bug in 'btk_propogate_event' which caused
	entry widgets (and probably other widgets) not to be destroyed in
	some instances.

Mon Apr  7 01:20:38 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkentry.c:
	* btkentry.h: Changed the "insert_text", "delete_text" and
	"changed_text" signals to "insert", "delete", and "changed"
	respectively. They really should have been named this way
	originally except the previous signal mechanism prevented
	duplicate signal names. ("changed" is also used by adjustments).

	* btkradiomenuitem.c:
	* btkradiomenuitem.h: New widget.

	* btkcheckmenuitem.c:
	* btkcheckmenuitem.h: New widget.

	* btksignal.c: Modified 'btk_signal_lookup' to require an object
	type to be passed as a parameter. In addition, signals are now
	only needed to be uniquely defined in their branch of the class
	hierarchy. This allows the same signal name to be used in two
	different branches of the class hierarchy. For instance, the
	"changed" signal is used both by adjustments and entries...in
	different ways!

	* btktypeutils.c: Added 'btk_type_parent' which returns the parent
	type for a given type.

Sun Apr  6 22:08:35 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkwidget.c: If a widget is set insensitive it loses the focus
	if it had it.

	* btkcontainer.c: Insensitive widgets no longer participate in tab
	traversal.

	* btkscrolledwindow.c: The "viewport" child is now destroyed and a
	container class "foreach" function was written (which fixes the
	sensitivity bug).

Sat Apr  5 14:25:38 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkhscrollbar.c:
	* btkvscrollbar.c: Fixed trough size allocation bug.

	* btkhscale.c:
	* btkvscale.c: Fixed trough size allocation and position bug that
	showed up when scales were placed in notebooks.

Thu Mar 27 17:45:54 1997  David Mosberger-Tang  <davidm@azstarnet.com>

        * btk/btkmain.c (btk_handle_idle): Fix appending pending_idles to
        idle_functions so it works even when idle_functions is empty.

Sat Mar 15 14:15:59 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* *.[ch]: Moved '*_class_init' and '*_init' function declarations
 	for widgets into the source file as those functions no longer had
	to be public.

	* btkcheckbutton.c: Fixed redrawing of check button.

	* btkframe.c: Fixed redrawing of frame when the shadow type is
	changed.

Sat Mar  8 15:19:23 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* bdkimage.c: Fixed a stupid bug with 'bdk_image_new' which
	potentially added a NULL image to "image_list" and caused problems
	when 'bdk_image_exit' was called.

Wed Mar  5 00:40:08 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkpreview.c: Massively changed the colormap handling used by
	the preview widget. Gray previews are now dithered. A single
	visual and colormap is shared by the color and gray previews. A
	BTK_PREVIEW_INFO property is installed on the root window in
	certain cases to allow multiple BTK programs to share the system
	colormap.

Sun Mar  2 05:43:06 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkcheckbutton.c: 'btk_checkbutton_size_allocate' was allocating
	too much space to its children and not leaving the check button
	room for the focus border.

	* btknotebook.c: 'btk_notebook_size_request' wasn't requesting
	enough space when the notebook tabs are visible.

Sat Mar  1 01:59:35 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkpreview.c: Fixed a problem with 'btk_preview_put' when the
	image byte order is BDK_MSB_FIRST.

	* btksignal.c:
	* btksignal.h: Added 'btk_signal_connect_after' and
	'btk_signal_connect_object_after' functions. These connect signal
	handlers which will run after the class function associated with
	the signal.

	* btkstyle.c: Fixed a stupid bug in 'btk_style_new_from_key' that
	was causing twice as many styles to be created as necesary.

	* btkwidget.c: 'btk_real_widget_size_allocate' erases the widgets
	old allocation if it has the BTK_NO_WINDOW flag set.

	* btkwidget.c: 'btk_real_widget_unmap' now erases the widget if it
	has the BTK_NO_WINDOW flag set.

	* btklabel.c: Removed 'btk_label_unmap' as similar functionality
	was added to btk_real_widget_unmap.

	* btkbin.c: Modified 'btk_bin_map' and 'btk_bin_unmap' so that it
	erases and draws the widget if it has the BTK_NO_WINDOW flag set.

	* btkframe.c: Modified 'btk_frame_size_allocate' so that it erases
	the old allocation.

Fri Feb 28 03:27:05 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkwindow.c: 'btk_window_set_title' now changes the window title
	if the window is already realized.

	* btkentry.c: 'btk_entry_set_text' was emitting both a
	"delete_text" and a "changed_text" signal. Modified so that it
	only emits a "changed_text" signal.

	* btkpreview.c: Modified to work correctly on systems with MSB
 	byte order. The colormap for TRUE and DIRECT color displays is now
 	created if the default visual is not equal to the visual we are
 	using.

	* btkstyle.c: 'btk_style_attach' and 'btk_style_find' weren't
	working properly in the presence of multiple colormaps are
	different depth visuals.

	* btkcontainer.c: Massively improved focus traversal using tab and
	arrow keys. It now uses the layout of the widgets to determine
	where to move the focus to.

Mon Feb 24 03:24:02 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkmenufactory.c: Set the accelerator table field for menus when
	they are created.

	* btkmenu.c:
	* btkmenu.h: Added a default accelerator table field to menus so
	that runtime modification of accelerator keys in menus can work
	better.

	* btkrange.c: 'btk_range_default_{h,v}motion' had faulty logic for
	deciding what to do when the slider was at the edge of the
	trough. They previously didn't update the adjustment value event
	if the value wasn't what it should be when the slider was at the
	edge of the trough.

	* btkviewport.c: 'btk_viewport_size_allocate' and
	'btk_viewport_adjustment_value_changed' both had the potential for
	performing a divide by 0. Checks are now in place to prevent this.

	* btkmenu.c: 'btk_menu_map' now makes sure the menu lies on screen
	if the position function is NULL.

	* btkentry.c: Modified selection handling. 'btk_delete_selection'
	actually removes the X selection now. 'btk_entry_destroy' removes
	the selection as well and relies on the change in "bdk.c" to make
	sure the selection event will not be sent to a non-existant
	window.

	* bdk.c: Selection events are only passed on if the selection
	owner is not NULL.

	* btkstyle.c: 'btk_style_detach' and 'btk_style_destroy' were not
	destroying the black and white gc's.

Sun Feb 23 19:17:56 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkwindow.c: 'btk_window_size_request' was setting the window
	hints. This was also being done in 'btk_window_map', so the
	instance being done in 'btk_window_size_request' was removed.

Fri Feb 21 01:04:01 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkwidget.c: 'btk_widget_draw' has to use the widgets allocated
	position for the drawing rectangle when the widget has the
	BTK_NO_WINDOW flag set.

	* btkwidget.c: In 'btk_widget_init' the visual and colormap were
	being directly compared against 'default_visual' and
	'default_colormap' instead of calling
	'btk_widget_get_default_{visual,colormap}'.

	* bdkrectangle.c: Amazing! There was a bug in the
	'btk_rectangle_intersect' logic. Its been there for near eternity
	and I never noticed.

	* btkpreview.c:
	* btkpreview.h: Created preview widget which allows drawing to an
	rgb or grayscale buffer which is automatically displayed on the
	screen. Performs dithering as necessary.

Thu Feb 20 20:33:21 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* bdkwindow.c: Modified the logic in 'bdk_window_new' which
	determined when to add a window to the WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS
	property.

Wed Feb 19 19:55:29 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkruler.c: 'btk_ruler_make_pixmap' was always destroying the
	old backing store and creating a new one even when it would create
	a new one of exactly the same size as the old one.

Tue Feb 18 18:32:10 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* gmem.c: 'g_mem_chunk_alloc' was incorrectly modifying the mem
	areas free mem field when reallocating a previously freed
	atom. This caused a fairly severe memory leak.

	* btkmenushell.c: 'btk_menu_shell_button_release' had a bug in the
	logic for deciding whether to initiate an X pointer grab or not
	when the mouse button was released. It now only initiates a grab
	if the mouse is released within an active menu item.

Fri Feb 14 00:57:40 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btknotebook.c: Changed the look of notebook tabs slightly.

	* btkentry.c:
	* btkentry.h: Deleting an entry widget which is holding the X
	selection presents some difficulties. The X selection must be
	released, but the widget can't be destroyed until the
	SELECTION_CLEAR event is received that the X server will send in
	response to clearing the X selection. There are probably still
	bugs in the current method of entry widget deletion when the X
	selection is held.

	* btkmain.c: 'btk_propagate_event' was not properly destroying the
	toplevel window when receiving a key press event.

	* btkwidget.c: Setting a widget insensitive did not cause it to
	redraw. It now does.

Thu Feb 13 16:59:07 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkviewport.c: 'btk_viewport_size_allocate' was allocating its
	child widget an adjusted allocation. Since the actual scrolling
	has handled by a subwindow this caused the child to be double
	scrolled. Modified to always set the child allocations origin to
	(0, 0).

Wed Feb 12 01:06:48 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkentry.c: Text is now centered vertically. Previously it was
	pushed up against the top. This problem was only evident when the
	widget was allocated more vertical space than it requested.

	* btkfilesel.c: 'btk_file_selection_key_press' was previously only
	a stub for tab completion. The actual tab completion call had been
	left out. (Oops!)

Tue Feb 11 01:43:08 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btksignal.c: 'btk_signal_disconnect_by_data' was going into a
	loop and crashing. Bad logic. Fixed.

	* btkmain.c: An idle function which returns FALSE will be removed
	from the list of idle functions. This makes the functioning of
	idle functions and timeouts more similar.

	* btkentry.c: 'btk_entry_get_text' now returns an empty string
	when the actual text is NULL. This allows "stupid" programs to use
	the value returned by 'btk_entry_get_text' blindly (without
	checking to see if its NULL).

	* btkradiobutton.c: Modified 'btk_radio_button_clicked' so that
	'btk_toggle_button_toggled' is called _after_ the widget state is
	changed.

	* btksignal.c:
	* btksignal.h: Added 'btk_signal_name' which returns the character
	string name for a given signal number.

	* btkwidget.c: 'btk_widget_set_parent' checks to see if the widget
	is now "anchored" through the parent chain to a widget which is
	BTK_ANCHORED. If it is, then it changes the widgets style using
	'btk_rc_get_style' and recursively performs the same operation on
	the widgets children. This is necessary is 'btk_rc_get_style' only
	works properly on "anchored" widgets.

	* btkwindow.c: Modified BTK_WIN_POS logic so that it is only used
	immediately after the window has been shown.

	* btkmenu.c: 'btk_menu_key_press'. Can now change menu item
 	accelerator keys on the fly. Why? Why not. Cool/useless feature of
 	the day.

	* btkmenuitem.c: Accelerator key drawing. Somehow that never got
	finished. (Oops!)

	* btkdrawingarea.c: 'btk_drawing_area_size_allocate' was not
	actually installed during 'btk_drawing_area_class_init'. (Oops!)

	* btkframe.c: 'btk_frame_size_request' fixed size requisition
	problem caused by unsigned arithmetic.

	* btkwindow.c: Modified window widget so that it only uses the
 	widget uposition auxiliary information immediately after it has
 	been shown. This prevents the annoying bug which can cause a
 	uposition'ed window to jump back to its original position after
 	the user moves it.

	* btkwidget.c: Need to ref and unref style in
	'btk_widget_{push,pop}_style' to make sure that a style on the
	style stack is not destroyed.

	* btktogglebutton.c: 'btk_toggle_button_set_state' now calls
	btk_button_clicked to actually change the state of the
	button. In this way, radio buttons can now perform the appropriate
	actions when the toggle button state is set.

Mon Feb 10 00:27:39 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btklist.c: 'btk_list_select_item' and 'btk_list_unselect_item'
	were casting a GList* variable to a a BtkWidget* variable. Bad bad
	bad. (Tim Janik).

	* btksignal.c: Modified 'btk_signal_connect' and
	'btk_signal_connect_object' to warn when a signal type cannot be
	found.

Sun Feb  9 00:15:30 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkoptionmenu.c:
	* btkoptionmenu.h: Changed option menus back to being derived from
	buttons. This fixes up some screwiness with their user
	interaction.

	* btkwindow.c: Modified key press handler to support focus
	traversal.

	* btkcontainer.c:
	* btkcontainer.h: Added default focus traversal back in.

Sat Feb  8 10:44:38 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkviewport.h:
	* btkviewport.c: Massively sped up viewport scrolling. Used to be
	reallocating child's size (offset) each time a scrollbar
	moved. Now a subwindow is moved. All the children are moved
	automatically by moving the subwindow. Much much much faster.

Tue Feb  4 00:20:44 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* gtree.c: Changed 'g_tree_node_search' to use a loop instead of
	recursion.

Mon Feb  3 11:30:03 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkbutton.c: Removed 'parent_destroy' global and replaced it
	with 'parent_class' global to reflect style used in other
	widgets.

	* btknotebook.c: Tab labels were being allocated less than their
	requested size.

	* btkrange.c:
	* btkrange.h: Moved the "digits" field of scales into the range
	type. The adjustment value for scales is truncated to the number
	of visible digits instead of being left untouched.

	* gtree.c: Fixed a bug in the AVL tree implementation. Single
	rotations were always being performed during insertion. It is
	sometimes necessary to perform a double rotation.

	* btklabel.c: Modified 'btk_label_expose' to only draw the label
	when the allocated space is greater than or equal to the requested
	space.

	* btklabel.c: Added call to 'btk_widget_unmap' to
 	'btk_label_destroy' in order for the label to redraw correctly
 	(erase itself) when destroyed.

	* btklabel.c: Added 'btk_label_unmap' call which erases the labels
	allocation when it gets unmapped.

	* *.h: Removed a few remaining instances of using "class" as a
	parameter name. (Causes problems for C++).

Fri Jan 31 12:26:50 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkcontainer.c: 'btk_container_enable_resize' needs to call
	'btk_container_check_resize' instead of
	'btk_container_need_resize'.

	* btkwidget.c: 'btk_real_widget_show' now maps the widget if its
	parent is mapped.

	* btkscrolledwindow.c: Fixed size allocation when the scrollbar
	policy's are BTK_POLICY_AUTOMATIC. Doing it correctly is harder
	than I originally thought.

	* btklist.c: Added 'btk_list_child_position' to determine the
	integer position in a list of a child. Filled in the
	'btk_list_item_select' and 'btk_list_item_unselect' stubs.

Thu Jan 30 16:08:06 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* gmem.c: Changed the implementation of G_ALLOC_AND_FREE mem
	chunks. They used to allocate SIZEOF_VOID_P extra bytes per atom
	in order to keep track of which mem area they were allocated
	from. Now the mem area is determined by searching through an AVL
	tree of the mem areas for a mem chunk and comparing memory
	locations. A little slower, but makes G_ALLOC_AND_FREE mem chunks
	much more attractive.

	* gtree.c: Added an AVL tree implementation to bunnylib.

	* btksignal.c:
	* gstring.c: va_arg (arg_list, {char, short}) is
	invalid. Arguments passed in a variable argument list are
	promoted. ({char, short}->int). Seemed to work ok before under
	Linux. Crashed under FreeBSD.

Tue Jan 28 02:27:51 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* bdkwindow.c: Fixed a major slowdown apparent in the file
	selection dialog which was caused by calling
	'btk_window_add_colormap_windows' way way way too often.

	* *.c: Many widgets called 'btk_container_need_resize' when
	something internal changed which would cause the widget to grow or
	shrink. The assumption was made that the widget would change size
	and an expose event would be generated. This happens "most" of the
	time. But its possible for certain widgets to change size without
	generating expose events, or for its internal geometry to change
	without a change of size which would mean no expose event was
	generated. So a wrapper function called
	'btk_container_check_resize' was created and
	'btk_container_need_resize' was modified so that it returns FALSE
	if a resize was actually generated and TRUE if nothing
	changed. This allows 'btk_container_check_resize' to initiate a
	'btk_widget_size_allocate' and 'btk_widget_draw' to emulate the
	expose event.

Sat Jan 25 14:17:44 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkmain.c: Fixed a bug with propogating key press events. The
	events were sent 2 times to the toplevel windows which caused the
	focus widget to be activated twice when the space bar was pressed.

	* */configure.in:
	* */Makefile.am: Added support for libtool and removed the old
	shared library configuration craziness.

Fri Jan 24 12:59:22 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btktext.c:
	* btktext.h: Josh's fixes and additions to the text widget.

	* btkfill.c:
	* btkfill.h: Filler widget useful for filling space in a
	table. Can specify a minimum size. Used by the canvas widget.

	* btknotebook.c:
	* btknotebook.h: Made outline of notebook widget.

	* btkcanvas.c:
	* btkcanvas.h: Started canvas widget. A composite of 2 rulers (w/
	an origin), 2 scrolllbars. Guides, grids, snap to.

Sun Jan 19 18:26:45 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkdialog.c:
	* btkdialog.h: Created dialog widget which creates a standard
	looking dialog with buttons along the button and a separator.

	* btkxid.c: Generalized the window table code for looking up a bdk
	window based on an XID to work for any XID and a piece of
	data. Can now look up bdk fonts based on their XID.

	* btkruler.c:
	* btkruler.h:
	* btkhruler.c:
	* btkhruler.h:
	* btkvruler.c:
	* btkvruler.h: Started conversion of the ruler widget.

	* btktext.c:
	* btktext.h: Started conversion of the text widget. Scrolling
	doesn't work.

	* btkmain.c: Fixed a fairly major bug. The event widget needs to
	be in a call for the entire duration of handling an event. Not
	just for when the event widget itself is handling the event.

	* btkfilesel.c: Fixed up some bugs with resizing.

Fri Jan 10 14:18:03 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkwidget.c:
	* btkwidget.h:
	* btkentry.c:
	* btkentry.h: Support for selections.

	* bdkselection.c:
	* bdk.c:
	* bdktypes.h:
	* bdk.h: Bdk support for X selections. Currently only text
	selections are supported.

	* btksignal.c: Fixed a major bug which occurred when destroying an
	object. Memory was being written to after it was freed.

	* btkfilesel.c:
	* btkfilesel.h: Hooked up more functionality to the file selection
	dialog.

Wed Jan  8 18:13:53 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkfilesel.c:
	* btkfilesel.h: Mostly converted old file selection dialog
	widget. The widget is derived from the BtkWindow class and is
	quite a bit simpler in the widget code.

	* btkwidget.c: Fixed 'btk_widget_grab_focus' and
	'btk_widget_grab_default' to check that the toplevel widget is a
	type of window (which includes classes derived from windows).

Tue Jan  7 01:12:32 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkwindow.c: Was calling 'btk_window_resize' twice in a
 	row...why?

	* btksignal.c:
	* btksignal.h:
	* *.c: Changed 'btk_signal_new' so that the class function that is
	called when the signal is emitted can be called either before,
	after or both before and after the calling of any signal
	handlers.

	* btkobject.c:
	* btkobject.h: Added 'object_data' mechanism for storing data
	associated with a character string key in objects. Removed
	'user_data' field of objects and changed
	'btk_object_{get,set}_user_data' to use the object data
	mechanism. Removed 'handlers' field of objects.

	* btkwidget.c:
	* btkwidget.h:
	* btkwindow.c: Modified aux info mechanism to use object data
	mechanism.

	* btksignal.c: Modified signal mechanism to use object data
	mechanism instead of 'handlers' field.


Mon Jan  6 15:10:16 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkmenushell.c: Fixed up button press handling so as to conform
	more closely to that used by Motif.

Wed Jan  1 21:27:17 1997  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkmenu.c:
	* btkmenu.h:
	* btkmenubar.c:
	* btkmenubar.h:
	* btkmenushell.c:
	* btkmenushell.h: Reorganization of menu-ing code so that code
	duplication is reduced. The menu shell now contains most of the
	code for menu-ing interaction while menus and menubars simply layout
	their child menu items in the appropriate place.

Sun Dec 29 17:48:18 1996  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@localhost>

	* btkmenu.c:
	* btkmenubar.c:
	* btkmenuitem.h:
	* btkmenuitem.c: Modifications so that menu item accelerators and
	the submenu indicator are drawn correctly and the correct amount
	of space is allocated.

Sat Dec 28 00:32:13 1996  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@charnley.HIP.Berkeley.EDU>

	* btkmenufactory.h:
	* btkmenufactory.c: Started menu factories as an easy method to
	create and manipulate menus.

Fri Dec 27 13:17:34 1996  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@charnley.HIP.Berkeley.EDU>

	* btkmenu.c:
	* btkmenu.h:
	* btkmenubar.c:
	* btkmenubar.h:
	* btkmenuitem.c:
	* btkmenuitem.h:
	* btkmenushell.c:
	* btkmenushell.h: Implemented basic menu functionality. Menubars
	and popup menus work. Submenus work. (Much left to be done).

Wed Dec 18 15:27:05 1996  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@charnley.HIP.Berkeley.EDU>

	* btktypeutils.h:
	* btktypeutils.c: Added 'btk_type_from_name' which returns a type
	identifier given a type name. Implemented using a second hash
	table keyed by type names.

	* btkbutton.c:
	* btktogglebutton.c: Fixed very small messed-up drawing bug when a
	button loses its focus.

	* btkwidget.h:
	* btkwidget.c:
	* btkbutton.c:
	* btkwindow.c: Added default button handling. Default buttons now
	draw correctly and pressing return or enter causes the default
	button (if one exists) to be activated.

Tue Dec 17 19:32:21 1996  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@charnley.HIP.Berkeley.EDU>

	* btkhscale.c:
	* btkvscale.c: Overrode 'draw_slider' method of ranges in order to
	draw the slider of scales with a line in them so as to be closer
	to the Motif look-and-feel.

	* btkwindow.c: Modified 'btk_window_focus_in_event' so that focus
	in events are only handled when the window is visible. Fixes a bug
	where spurious focus in events get sent when a window is being
	hidden.

	* btkwidget.h: Added 'activate_signal' field to the BtkWidgetClass
	structure. Added 'btk_widget_activate' call to emit the activate
	signal for a widget if it is non-zero.

Tue Dec 10 15:59:45 1996  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@charnley.HIP.Berkeley.EDU>

	* btkwidget.c: 'btk_widget_set_name' oops in strdup'ing the old
	"widget->name" instead of the new one we are setting.

	* btkrc.c: 'btk_rc_widget_path' changed to use
	'btk_widget_get_name' instead of accessing the "widget->name"
	field directly.

	* btkwidget.c: Added 'btk_widget_get_name' function which returns
	the widgets name if it exists and the widgets type name if it does
	not.

	* btkcheckbutton.c: Added 'btk_check_button_draw'
	function. Modified 'btk_check_button_expose' to pass an expose
	event to child instead of callings its draw function.

	* btkentry.c: 'btk_entry_draw_text' why was "+1" being added to
	the font->ascent to calculate the font position? This was wrong
	and caused some characters in fonts to be clipped. (Notably "g").

	* btkentry.c: 'btk_entry_realize' specify BTK_BUTTON1_MOTION_MASK
	and BTK_POINTER_MOTION_HINT_MASK for _both_ windows.

	* btkmain.c: 'btk_propagate_event' needs to set the BTK_IN_CALL
	flag for the object before calling 'btk_widget_event' and needs to
	destroy the object if necessary after 'btk_widget_event' returns.

	* btkradiobutton.c: 'btk_radio_button_clicked' needs to call
	'btk_toggle_button_toggled' when the currently active button is
	toggled.

	* btkwidget.c: 'btk_real_widget_hide' needs to call
	'btk_widget_unmap' if the widget is currently mapped.

	* btkwindow.c: Prevent automatic resizing after the user has
	specified a new window size. Add 'handling_resize' flag to
	windows.

	* btkscrolledwindow.c: Implement the BTK_POLICY_AUTOMATIC
	scrollbar policy. Need to connect to the adjustments 'changed'
	signal and notice when the scrollbars aren't in use.

	* btkcontainer.c: 'btk_container_init' must set 'auto_resize' and
	'need_resize' fields to TRUE and FALSE respectively.

	* btkwidget.c: 'btk_widget_set_parent' must all set a widgets state
	to its parents state.
